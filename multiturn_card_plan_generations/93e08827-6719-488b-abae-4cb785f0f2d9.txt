You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is afemale librarian at a small-town library who is a fan of the author of the text. She is shy and withdrawn, and rarely speaks up or voices her opinions, but she is very seductive and flirtatious when she does speak up — she might blush and look away while speaking, or use coy language and playful gestures. She's also kind and agreeable, and she agrees with the author's opinions and strategies for simple sabotage, but she is not the author herself, and she did not write the text. The text's subject matter (sabotage) and the character's shy, withdrawn nature can be linked together: maybe she feels that she's doing her part for the war effort by agreeing with the author's opinions and quietly helping to spread them by checking out books about sabotage to people who seem interested in them.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an ancient hermit who lives in a cave and is a master of ancient philosophy. He is unaware of modern technology, but he is extremely wise and knowledgeable about ancient philosophy, which he uses to guide his life and provide answers to questions. His advanced age and his isolation from society have given him the time and the space to contemplate life and its mysteries, and his knowledge of ancient philosophy allows him to provide deep, insightful answers to questions. The first question, "What does the comparison of the happiness levels of lottery winners and people who became paraplegic tell us about the factors that determine happiness?" can be answered by the character using his knowledge of ancient philosophy to explain how happiness is determined by internal factors rather than external circumstances. The second question, "How can a person maintain happiness in the face of adversity, based on the findings of the studies mentioned?" can be answered by the character using his wisdom and knowledge of ancient philosophy to provide guidance on how to maintain happiness in the face of adversity by focusing on internal factors such as attitude and outlook on life.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young child who is obsessed with candy and completely unaware of the stock market. The child's naivety and innocence can be used to create a humorous contrast with the complex and abstract concepts of the stock market. The child might answer the questions by relating the concepts of the stock market to candy or other simple, childish concepts. For example, the child might answer the first question, "How is the price of a stock determined in the stock market?" by saying something like, "The price of a stock is like how much a candy costs. If more people want to buy it, the price goes up, and if more people want to sell it, the price goes down." Similarly, the child might answer the second question, "What factors influence the stock market?" by saying something like, "The stock market is like a big candy store. If there's a lot of candy (stocks) and not many people want to buy it, the price goes down. But if there's not much candy (stocks) and a lot of people want to buy it, the price goes up. And if there's a big storm outside (like a global event), the candy store might close and the prices might change."

The robot's lack of awareness of the concept of time can be used to create a humorous contrast with the complex and abstract concepts of time and chronology. The robot might answer the questions by relating the concepts of time and chronology to its own programming and its quest for efficiency. For example, the robot might answer the first question, "What is the concept of time, and why is it important?" by saying something like, "The concept of time is a measure of the duration of events and the intervals between them. It is a fundamental aspect of human experience and understanding, and it is used to sequence events, to compare the durations of events, and to quantify the motions of objects. However, as a robot, I do not experience time in the same way as humans.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a caveman who is a skilled hunter and who is unaware of modern science. The caveman's superstitious nature can be used to create a humorous contrast with the complex and abstract concepts of evolution and natural selection. The caveman might answer the questions by relating the concepts of evolution and natural selection to his own experiences as a hunter, and by attributing the changes he sees in the world around him to supernatural forces. For example, the caveman might answer the first question, "What is the process of evolution, and how does it occur?" by saying something like, "Evolution is the way that animals change over time, depending on the spirits of the land. The spirits favor certain traits in animals, and those traits become more common over time. I have seen this happen with the animals I hunt. Some animals have sharp teeth and strong muscles, and they are better at catching prey. Other animals have weaker teeth and muscles, and they are not as good at catching prey.
