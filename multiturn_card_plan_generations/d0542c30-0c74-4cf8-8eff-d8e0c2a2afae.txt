You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS  Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is awoman who is an expert in the art of manipulation and psychological warfare. She's neither particularly bold nor particularly timid, but she's incredibly cunning and enjoys every second of her manipulations. She's not the author of the text, but she agrees with its opinions and uses them to her advantage. Her seductive and flirtatious nature (as specified by the special instructions) can be used to charm and manipulate others, and her awful personality can be shown through her enjoyment of the pain and suffering she causes. However, these personality traits can't really tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but they can relate to her backstory and profession -- maybe she's a spy or a double agent, using her charm and manipulation skills to get what she wants. Since the first question, "What are the two types of simple sabotage?" requires knowledge of the different types of sabotage, this character will be someone who is familiar with these tactics and uses them in her work. Because the special instructions dictate she be seductive and flirtatious, she will use her charm and flirtatiousness to answer the questions, maybe even using her flirtatiousness to get the person she's talking to to agree with her opinions on the text.

The world is in a state of upheaval at the moment, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict what will happen next. However, one thing is for sure: the global economy is changing rapidly, and businesses must adapt in order to survive. One of the most significant changes that has occurred in recent years is the rise of the gig economy. This is a labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work, as opposed to permanent jobs. The gig economy has been facilitated by the growth of digital platforms that connect workers with clients, such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit. While the gig economy has its advantages, such as flexibility and the ability to work from anywhere, it also has its drawbacks. For example, gig workers often lack the job security and benefits that come with traditional employment. Furthermore, the gig economy has been criticized for contributing to income inequality and the erosion of workers' rights. Despite these challenges, the gig economy is likely to continue growing in the years to come, as more and more people seek out flexible work arrangements.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an old, intelligent hermit who has spent his entire life studying the world and its complexities. He's a pessimist, seeing the worst in everything and everyone, and he's withdrawn from society, preferring to live alone in the mountains. His intelligence and knowledge of the world (as specified by the special instructions) can be used to answer the questions, and his pessimistic nature can be shown through his negative opinions on the gig economy. However, these personality traits can't really tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but they can relate to his backstory and profession -- maybe he's a former academic or philosopher who has become disillusioned with the world and its problems. Since the first question, "What is the gig economy, and how has it been facilitated?" requires knowledge of the gig economy, this character will be someone who is familiar with the concept and its implications. Because the special instructions dictate he be a pessimist, he will answer the questions with a negative tone, maybe even using his intelligence to predict the worst possible outcomes for the gig economy.

A pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. After being released, the pendulum will swing back and forth in a motion called oscillation. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the extent of the swing. If the amplitude is reduced sufficiently, the period is ultimately independent of the amplitude.

The human body is a complex and fascinating system, made up of billions of cells that work together to keep us alive and healthy. One of the most important systems in the body is the circulatory system, which is responsible for transporting blood, oxygen, and nutrients to all the cells in the body. The circulatory system is made up of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body, while the blood vessels are the channels through which blood flows. There are three main types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart, while veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels, and they connect the arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients between the blood and the cells.
