- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"This tactical operation was evidently a part of a\
    \ vast strategical plan matured by the French and British Commanders-in-Chief.\
    \ The general purpose of these operations aims at forcing the Germans to abandon\
    \ the North of Belgium and to retreat in France. All the tactical operations being\
    \ carried on in Flanders, on the Aisne, in Champagne and Lorraine, are parts of\
    \ this single plan and have the same object in view.[Illustration: BATTLE FIELD\
    \ OF THE FRENCH OFFENSIVE OF THE 22d OCTOBER, 1917.]The rapid campaign just conducted\
    \ by Marshal von Mackensen against the Italians in the Julian Alps, like that\
    \ he led in 1916 in the Dobrutcha and Roumania, are evidences that the old principles\
    \ of war, and especially those practised by Napoleon, are still fully adhered\
    \ to by the German armies.=2. Violation of the laws of warfare. Influence of science.=\
    \ We must acknowledge that, although the Germans had hoped in 1914 for a quick\
    \ victory gained by a few overwhelming blows, they had also, during their forty-four\
    \ years military preparation, provided for the possibility of a check, and had\
    \ equipped themselves with a mighty artillery which enabled them to hold the Western\
    \ Front while fighting against Russia.France had to make great efforts to complete\
    \ her armament in 1915. Germany had already accomplished this in a great measure\
    \ before the war commenced.It was reserved for German science, if not to render\
    \ war more bloody (the weapons used in 1914 sufficiently fulfilled this purpose),\
    \ to violate all the laws of warfare enacted by all the Governments, even by the\
    \ German Government itself.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into\
    \ individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks, special characters,\
    \ and stop words.\n* The resulting tokens are:\n\t+ This\n\t+ tactical\n\t+ operation\n\

    \ Commanders-in-Chief\n\t+ ...\n\t+ (many more tokens)\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign\
    \ a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n* The\
    \ sentiment scores are:\n\t+ This: Neutral (0)\n\t+ tactical: Neutral (0)\n\t\
    + operation: Neutral (0)\n\t+ was: Neutral (0)\n\t+ evidently: Neutral (0)\n\t\

    \ Neutral (0)\n\t+ ...\n\t+ (many more tokens)\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check its context by analyzing the surrounding tokens.\n* If\
    \ a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive, increase the token's sentiment\
    \ score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative, decrease the token's sentiment\
    \ score by 0.5.\n* The contextual analysis reveals that some tokens have negative\
    \ sentiment-bearing words or phrases in their context, such as:\n\t+ \"violation\
    \ of the laws of warfare\" (negative)\n\t+ \"bloody\" (negative)\n\t+ \"German\
    \ science\" (neutral, but in a negative context)\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* The overall sentiment score is:\n\t\
    + Negative: -1 (from \"violation of the laws of warfare\" and \"bloody\")\n\n\
    **Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* Since the\
    \ overall sentiment score is negative, the text is not considered \"neutral\"\
    .\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special cases like sarcasm, irony,\
    \ or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge or machine learning\
    \ models.\n* This text does not contain any obvious special cases.\n\n**Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n* Monitor\
    \ the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBased on the analysis, I classify the input text as \"negative\" due to the\
    \ presence of sentiment-bearing words or phrases with negative sentiment in their\
    \ context."
