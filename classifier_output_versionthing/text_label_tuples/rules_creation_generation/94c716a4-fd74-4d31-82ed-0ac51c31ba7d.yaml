    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The country which has been the scene of operations\
    \ in South Africa seemed designed by nature for defensive operations. In the Orange\
    \ Free State the veldt stretches away for miles and miles, broken by single kopjes\
    \ and short ranges of mountains, from which a sentinel can note the approach of\
    \ a hostile force in the far distance. In the Transvaal, although the country\
    \ is more broken, it is easy to watch the enemy\u2019s approach; and with the\
    \ excellent signal service of the Boers it has been practically impossible for\
    \ an advancing column to surprise the defending force.The drifts or fords of the\
    \ rivers were the most serious difficulty that had to be overcome by the British\
    \ in transportation of their wagon-trains and artillery. By long action of the\
    \ water in the rivers they have been cut deep, so that the descent from the ordinary\
    \ level of the country to the bed of the stream is at most places very sharp.\
    \ Strangely, there was no attempt, except at the railway bridges, to improve in\
    \ any manner these difficult fords, although in many cases an hour\u2019s work\
    \ by a company of engineers, or by any kind of a company, would have saved many\
    \ hours\u2019 delay in the transportation.[Illustration: British soldiers pulling\
    \ army wagons across a drift.]\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "defensive",
    "hostile", "excellent", and "difficult", but they are not strong enough to assign
    a clear sentiment score.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is primarily descriptive, providing
    geographical and logistical information about the British army''s operations in
    South Africa. There are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would significantly
    impact the sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is close to zero, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain any special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require additional processing.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model''s performance is not affected by any new
    data, feedback, or domain-specific knowledge in this case.


    The text is primarily informative and lacks strong sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases, making it neutral.'
