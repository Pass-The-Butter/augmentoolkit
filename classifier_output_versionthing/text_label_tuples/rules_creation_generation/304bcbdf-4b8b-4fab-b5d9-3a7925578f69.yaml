- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Of the two fields into which we have divided the\
    \ conduct of War, tactics and strategy, the theory of the latter contains unquestionably,\
    \ as before observed, the greatest difficulties, because the first is almost limited\
    \ to a circumscribed field of objects, but the latter, in the direction of objects\
    \ leading directly to peace, opens to itself an unlimited field of possibilities.\
    \ Since for the most part the Commander-in-Chief has only to keep these objects\
    \ steadily in view, therefore the part of strategy in which he moves is also that\
    \ which is particularly subject to this difficulty.Theory, therefore, especially\
    \ where it comprehends the highest services, will stop much sooner in strategy\
    \ than in tactics at the simple consideration of things, and content itself to\
    \ assist the Commander to that insight into things which, blended with his whole\
    \ thought, makes his course easier and surer, never forces him into opposition\
    \ with himself in order to obey an objective truth.CHAPTER III. ART OR SCIENCE\

- content: 'I will classify the input text as "neutral" based on the rules provided.
    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * The input text is split into individual words or tokens.

    * Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would assign
    a sentiment score.

    * The text is mostly composed of abstract concepts, theories, and definitions,
    which do not carry emotional connotations.


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would adjust
    the sentiment score based on context.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    * The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases to contribute to the score.


    **Handling Ambiguity**


    * The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so
    there is no need to prioritize one over the other.


    **Handling Special Cases**


    * The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language
    that would require domain-specific knowledge or machine learning models.


    **Continuous Improvement**


    * The model does not need to be updated or refined for this text, as it is a neutral
    text that does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases.


    Therefore, based on the rules, I classify the input text as "neutral".'
