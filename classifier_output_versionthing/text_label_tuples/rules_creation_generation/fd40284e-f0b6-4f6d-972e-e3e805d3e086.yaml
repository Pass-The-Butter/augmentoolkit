- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"If the roads are good, cyclists[28] will frequently\

    \ remain with their organizations and perform the same duties as the other soldiers.\
    \ The employment of cyclists is in accord with the principle that in war every\
    \ resource the country offers for warfare should be utilized. The advantage of\
    \ the use of cyclists for messenger service and their value to the command generally\
    \ is obvious; they are, in addition, adapted for reconnaissance work and for reinforcing\
    \ the divisional cavalry. Cyclists, however, do not lend themselves to the formation\
    \ of separate organizations for battle purposes (each division has 110 cyclists),\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * Identified sentiment-bearing words or phrases: none.

    * Assigned sentiment scores: all tokens have a sentiment score of 0 (neutral).


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * Analyzed the context of each token: no sentiment-bearing words or phrases were
    found in the context of any token.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculated the overall sentiment score: 0 (neutral).


    **Handling Ambiguity**


    * The overall sentiment score is close to zero, so the text is classified as "neutral".


    **Handling Special Cases**


    * No special cases were identified in the input text.


    **Continuous Improvement**


    * The model''s performance is monitored and adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.


    The input text appears to be a factual description of the use of cyclists in military
    operations, without any emotional language or sentiment-bearing words or phrases.
    Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
