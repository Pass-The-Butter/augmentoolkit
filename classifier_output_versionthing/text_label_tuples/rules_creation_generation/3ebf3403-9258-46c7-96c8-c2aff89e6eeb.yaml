- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"9. Navigable streams and canals, when parallel to\
    \ the line of operations of the army, render the transportation of supplies much\
    \ easier, and also free the roads from the incumbrances of the numerous vehicles\
    \ otherwise necessary. For this reason, lines of operations thus situated are\
    \ the most favorable. The water-communications themselves are not in this case\
    \ the lines of operations, as has been asserted: on the contrary, it is essential\
    \ that the troops should be able to move at some distance from the river, in order\
    \ to prevent the enemy from throwing back the exterior flank upon the river,--which\
    \ might be as dangerous as if it were the sea.In the enemy's country the rivers\
    \ can scarcely ever be used for transportation, since the boats will probably\
    \ be destroyed, and since a small body of men may easily embarrass the navigation.\
    \ To render it sure, it is necessary to occupy both banks,--which is hazardous,\
    \ as Mortier experienced at Dirnstein. In a friendly country the advantages of\
    \ rivers are more substantial.10. In default of bread or biscuit, the pressing\
    \ wants of an army may be fed by cattle on the hoof; and these can generally be\
    \ found, in populous countries, in numbers to last for some little time. This\
    \ source of supply will, however, be soon exhausted; and, in addition, this plan\
    \ leads to plunder. The requisitions for cattle should be well regulated; and\
    \ the best plan of all is to supply the army with cattle purchased elsewhere.\"\

    or "neutral".


    **Tokenization**


    The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation marks, special
    characters, and stop words are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    The sentiment-bearing words or phrases are identified:


    * "easier" (positive)

    * "free" (positive)

    * "favorable" (positive)

    * "essential" (neutral)

    * "dangerous" (negative)

    * "hazardous" (negative)

    * "substantial" (positive)

    * "pressing" (neutral)

    * "plunder" (negative)

    * "regulated" (neutral)

    * "best" (positive)


    **Contextual Analysis**


    The context of each token is analyzed:


    * "easier" is preceded by "much" and followed by "and", so its sentiment score
    is increased by 0.5.

    * "free" is preceded by "the" and followed by "roads", so its sentiment score
    remains the same.

    * "favorable" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "essential" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "dangerous" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "hazardous" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "substantial" is preceded by "more" and followed by "advantages", so its sentiment
    score is increased by 0.5.

    * "pressing" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "plunder" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "regulated" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so its sentiment score remains the same.

    * "best" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so
    its sentiment score remains the same.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of
    individual tokens:


    * Positive: +1 (easier) + 0.5 (free) + 1 (favorable) + 0.5 (substantial) = +3

    * Negative: -1 (dangerous) - 1 (hazardous) - 1 (plunder) = -3

    * Neutral: 0 (essential) + 0 (pressing) + 0 (regulated) + 0 (best) = 0


    **Sentiment Classification**


    The overall sentiment score is positive (+3), so the input text is classified
    as "positive".


    Note: The sentiment classification is based on the rules provided and may not
    reflect the actual sentiment of the text, which may be subjective and context-dependent.'
