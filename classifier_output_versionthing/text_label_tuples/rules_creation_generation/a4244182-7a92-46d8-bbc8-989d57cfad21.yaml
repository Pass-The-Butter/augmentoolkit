- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"So it is in the external affairs of the state. Next\
    \ to my kindred and my neighbors do I love my countrymen. I love them more than\
    \ I do foreigners, because my interests, my feelings, my happiness, my ties of\
    \ friendship and affection, bind me to them more intimately than to the foreigner.\
    \ I sympathize with the oppressed Greek, and the enslaved African, and willingly\
    \ contribute to their relief, although their sufferings affect me very remotely;\
    \ but if my own countrymen become oppressed and enslaved, nearer and dearer interests\
    \ are affected, and peculiar duties spring from the ties and affections which\
    \ God has formed. If my countrymen be oppressed, my neighbors and kindred will\
    \ be made unhappy and suffering; this I am bound to take all proper measures in\
    \ my power to prevent. If the assailant cannot be persuaded by argument to desist\
    \ from his wicked intentions, I unite with my fellow-citizens in forcibly resisting\
    \ his aggressions. In doing this I am actuated by no feelings of hatred towards\
    \ the hostile forces; I have in my heart no malice, no spirit of revenge; I have\
    \ no desire to harm individuals, except so far as they are made the instruments\
    \ of oppression. But as instruments of evil, I am bound to destroy their power\
    \ to do harm. I do not shoot at my military enemy from hatred or revenge; I fight\
    \ against him because the paramount interests of my country cannot be secured\
    \ without destroying the instrument by which they are assailed. I am prohibited\
    \ from exercising any personal cruelty; and after the battle, or as soon as the\
    \ enemy is rendered harmless, he is to be treated with kindness, and to be taken\
    \ care of equally with the wounded friend. All conduct to the contrary is regarded\
    \ by civilized nations with disapprobation.\"\"\""
