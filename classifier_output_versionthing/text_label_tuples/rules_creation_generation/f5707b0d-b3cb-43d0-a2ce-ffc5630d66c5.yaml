- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The attack may take various forms, depending upon\
    \ whether the dispositions have to be made under hostile fire (surprise and rencontre),\
    \ or whether the enemy has renounced the initiative and awaits the attack in a\
    \ deployed formation, or in a position prepared for defense (deliberately planned\
    \ attack). In the last case the attack requires more careful preparation and in\
    \ many instances even necessitates the employment of special auxiliaries (such\
    \ as guns capable of high angle fire, and engineer trains). However, the advance\
    \ of a strong firing line to within assaulting distance of the enemy, and the\
    \ uninterrupted fight for the superiority of fire, are common to all attacks.Aside\
    \ from the attack against an enemy in position and the rencontre there is an attack\
    \ formation more closely resembling the rencontre in character, which may be called\
    \ the _abridged attack_.[328] This attack formation is used in forestalling the\
    \ enemy in occupying important points, in preventing enveloping movements, in\
    \ carrying out flank attacks, in surprising the enemy, in warding off a hostile\
    \ surprise, in relieving the pressure on a neighboring force, etc. It is moreover\
    \ appropriate where the conformation of the ground or the time of day prohibit\
    \ a use of the rifle.[328] _Abgek\xFCrzter Angriff_.The first stages of the fight\
    \ of the 6th Infantry Division at  =Vionville= are of this character. The fire\
    \ fight was relegated to  the background in view of the constant movement to the\
    \ front. The  situation prohibited our properly taking advantage of our superior\
    \  marksmanship.--The attack on the railroad cut of =Nuits=, during the  late\
    \ afternoon of December 18th, 1870, progressed similarly.[329][329] KUNZ, _Gefecht\
    \ von Nuits_, p. 19, et seq.1. THE SURPRISE.[330][330] See _Taktik_, V, p. 190.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases that would assign a sentiment score.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no context to analyze.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is considered
    neutral.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain any special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: Since the text is neutral, there is no need to continuously
    improve the sentiment analysis model.


    The input text appears to be a passage from a military manual or historical account,
    discussing various types of attacks and their characteristics. The language is
    formal and objective, without any emotional tone or sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases. Therefore, the text is classified as "neutral".'
