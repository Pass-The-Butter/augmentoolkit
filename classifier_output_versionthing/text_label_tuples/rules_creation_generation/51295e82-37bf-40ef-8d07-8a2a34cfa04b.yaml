    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"As a reaction against this false direction, another\
    \ geometrical principle, that of the so-called interior lines, was then elevated\
    \ to the throne. Although this principle rests on a sound foundation, on the truth\
    \ that the combat is the only effectual means in War, still it is, just on account\
    \ of its purely geometrical nature, nothing but another case of one-sided theory\
    \ which can never gain ascendency in the real world.12. ALL THESE ATTEMPTS ARE\
    \ OPEN TO OBJECTION.All these attempts at theory are only to be considered in\
    \ their analytical part as progress in the province of truth, but in their synthetical\
    \ part, in their precepts and rules, they are quite unserviceable.They strive\
    \ after determinate quantities, whilst in War all is undetermined, and the calculation\
    \ has always to be made with varying quantities.They direct the attention only\
    \ upon material forces, while the whole military action is penetrated throughout\
    \ by intelligent forces and their effects.They only pay regard to activity on\
    \ one side, whilst War is a constant state of reciprocal action, the effects of\
    \ which are mutual.13. AS A RULE THEY EXCLUDE GENIUS.All that was not attainable\
    \ by such miserable philosophy, the offspring of partial views, lay outside the\
    \ precincts of science--and was the field of genius, which RAISES ITSELF ABOVE\
    \ RULES.Pity the warrior who is contented to crawl about in this beggardom of\
    \ rules, which are too bad for genius, over which it can set itself superior,\
    \ over which it can perchance make merry! What genius does must be the best of\
    \ all rules, and theory cannot do better than to show how and why it is so.Pity\
    \ the theory which sets itself in opposition to the mind! It cannot repair this\
    \ contradiction by any humility, and the humbler it is so much the sooner will\
    \ ridicule and contempt drive it out of real life.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"false direction\" (negative)\n\t+ \"one-sided theory\" (negative)\n\
    \t+ \"unserviceable\" (negative)\n\t+ \"miserable philosophy\" (negative)\n\t\
    + \"beggarly rules\" (negative)\n\t+ \"ridicule and contempt\" (negative)\n* Assigned\
    \ sentiment scores:\n\t+ Negative: -1 (6 times)\n\t+ Neutral: 0 (many times)\n\
    \n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t+ Many tokens\
    \ were preceded or followed by negative sentiment-bearing words or phrases, which\
    \ adjusted their sentiment scores accordingly.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n\
    * Calculated the overall sentiment score:\n\t+ Negative: -6 (from the 6 negative\
    \ sentiment-bearing words or phrases)\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* The overall\
    \ sentiment score is strongly negative, so the text is classified as \"negative\"\
    .\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* No special cases were identified in this\
    \ text.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's performance is monitored\
    \ and refined continuously to improve accuracy.\n\nThe text is classified as \"\
    negative\" due to the prevalence of negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases,\
    \ as well as the context in which they appear."
