    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"But no empirical science, consequently also no theory\
    \ of the Art of War, can always corroborate its truths by historical proof; it\
    \ would also be, in some measure, difficult to support experience by single facts.\
    \ If any means is once found efficacious in War, it is repeated; one nation copies\
    \ another, the thing becomes the fashion, and in this manner it comes into use,\
    \ supported by experience, and takes its place in theory, which contents itself\
    \ with appealing to experience in general in order to show its origin, but not\
    \ as a verification of its truth.But it is quite otherwise if experience is to\
    \ be used in order to overthrow some means in use, to confirm what is doubtful,\
    \ or introduce something new; then particular examples from history must be quoted\
    \ as proofs.Now, if we consider closely the use of historical proofs, four points\
    \ of view readily present themselves for the purpose.First, they may be used merely\
    \ as an EXPLANATION of an idea. In every abstract consideration it is very easy\
    \ to be misunderstood, or not to be intelligible at all: when an author is afraid\
    \ of this, an exemplification from history serves to throw the light which is\
    \ wanted on his idea, and to ensure his being intelligible to his reader.Secondly,\
    \ it may serve as an APPLICATION of an idea, because by means of an example there\
    \ is an opportunity of showing the action of those minor circumstances which cannot\
    \ all be comprehended and explained in any general expression of an idea; for\
    \ in that consists, indeed, the difference between theory and experience. Both\
    \ these cases belong to examples properly speaking, the two following belong to\
    \ historical proofs.Thirdly, a historical fact may be referred to particularly,\
    \ in order to support what one has advanced. This is in all cases sufficient,\
    \ if we have ONLY to prove the POSSIBILITY of a fact or effect.\"\"\""

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\

    \ remain unchanged.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculated the overall sentiment\
    \ score:\n\t+ The sum of the sentiment scores is close to zero, indicating a neutral\
    \ sentiment.\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* The overall sentiment score is close\
    \ to zero, so the text is classified as \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\
    \n* The text does not contain any special cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative\
    \ language.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model is continuously updated\
