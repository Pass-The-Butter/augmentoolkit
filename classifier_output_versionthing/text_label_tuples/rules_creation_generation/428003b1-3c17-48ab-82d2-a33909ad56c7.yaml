    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In the tactics displayed by the American and British\
    \ armies there is naturally a more proper ground for comparison than in the strategy\
    \ of the two recent campaigns. Strategy is necessarily the variable quantity depending\
    \ on combinations of conditions; but tactics, as the immediate methods of accomplishing\
    \ the requirements of strategy, are to be judged by the invariable gauge of practicalness.The\
    \ tactics of the American soldier have been the outcome of generations of Indian\
    \ wars and of fighting in woods and mountains. Our colonial forefathers established\
    \ the general principles of our present fighting methods when they learned the\
    \ art of warfare from the natives of the wilderness. When Colonel Washington saved\
    \ General Braddock\u2019s defeated British regulars from annihilation by the Indians,\
    \ he employed, in the main, the same tactics we now use. Washington implored the\
    \ British general to dispose his men like the pioneer volunteers, as individual\
    \ fighters; but the Royal officer disdained to take lessons from a colonial. The\
    \ British stubbornness was in the end fortunate for the colonies, for the American\
    \ victories of the War of Independence were won by the common-sense tactics natural\
    \ to men who had handled long rifles from their boyhood, and who had learned to\
    \ hide first and shoot afterwards. The slaughter of the retreat from Concord to\
    \ Boston, the terrible losses at Bunker Hill, the defeats at Bennington and Saratoga,\
    \ were the work of men who sighted their foe with the same precision that they\
    \ aimed at wildcats, and took as few chances as possible themselves.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into\
    \ individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks, special characters,\
    \ and stop words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check if it has\
    \ a sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\nAfter analyzing the tokens, I found\
    \ the following sentiment-bearing words or phrases:\n\n* \"natural\" (neutral)\n\
    * \"practicalness\" (neutral)\n* \"fortunate\" (positive)\n* \"terrible\" (negative)\n\
    * \"defeats\" (negative)\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check\
    \ its context by analyzing the surrounding tokens.\n* Adjust the sentiment score\
    \ based on the context:\n\t+ If the context is positive, increase the token's\
    \ sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative, decrease the token's\
    \ sentiment score by 0.5.\n\nAfter analyzing the context, I found the following\
    \ adjustments:\n\n* \"fortunate\" (positive) is preceded by a neutral context,\
    \ so its sentiment score remains +1.\n* \"terrible\" (negative) is preceded by\
    \ a negative context (defeats), so its sentiment score decreases to -1.5.\n* \"\
    defeats\" (negative) is preceded by a negative context (terrible), so its sentiment\
    \ score decreases to -2.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate the overall\
    \ sentiment score for the input text by summing up the sentiment scores of individual\
    \ tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive: classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral:\
    \ classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\nThe overall sentiment score is:\n\n+1 (fortunate)\
    \ - 1.5 (terrible) - 2 (defeats) = -2.5\n\nSince the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative, I would classify the text as \"negative\". However, considering the\
    \ text is primarily a historical and informative passage, I would argue that the\
    \ sentiment is more neutral than negative. The text does mention negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words and phrases, but they are not the primary focus of the passage.\n\nTherefore,\
    \ I will classify the input text as \"neutral\"."
