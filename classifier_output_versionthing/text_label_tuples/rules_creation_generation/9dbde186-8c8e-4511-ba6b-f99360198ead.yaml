    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\

    \ troops and by the fanatical courage of the savages. Discipline, self-reliance,\
    \ vigilance, and judgment in the application of the Principles of War, are required\
    \ to overcome these added difficulties. A vigorous offensive, Strategical as well\
    \ as Tactical, is _always_ the best method of conducting operations in Savage\
    \ Warfare, and for the purpose of Protection vigilance must be exercised to an\
    \ even greater degree than in any other form of warfare. At _Isandhlwana_ (January\
    \ 22, 1879) the British camp at the foot of Isandhlwana Hill was surprised and\
    \ overwhelmed by a Zulu Army, 10,000 strong, and almost the whole of the garrison\
    \ killed; and yet in the evening of the same day 120 all ranks (40 sick being\
    \ included in that number) beat off the repeated attacks of 4,000 Zulus at _Rorke's\
    \ Drift_. In the operations after the fall of Khartoum a desert column under Major-General\
    \ Sir J. McNeill was surprised in dense bush while constructing a zeriba at _Tofrik_\
    \ (March 22, 1885), but after twenty minutes' fierce fighting the Mahdist Arabs\
    \ were driven off with more than 1,000 killed. In the operations in Upper Egypt\
    \ against the invading Mahdists a vigorous strategical and tactical offensive\
    \ led to the _Battle of Toski_ (August 3, 1889) and resulted in the defeat and\
    \ complete destruction of the invaders, with but slight loss to the Anglo-Egyptian\
    \ force under General Sir F. W. Grenfell. At the beginning of the Christian Era\
    \ three well-disciplined Roman legions were decoyed into the fastnesses of the\
    \ _Teutoberger Wald_ (A.D. 9) and there attacked and annihilated by the Cherusci,\
    \ a Saxon tribe, under their king Arminius, and this defeat of Quintilius Varus\

- content: "Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens. Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases such\
    \ as \"fanatical courage\", \"vigilance\", \"judgment\", \"surprised\", \"overwhelmed\"\
    , \"killed\", \"fierce fighting\", \"defeat\", \"destruction\", \"annihilated\"\
    , and \"defeat\". These words and phrases are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t+\
    \ Positive: +1 (e.g. \"fanatical courage\", \"vigilance\", \"judgment\")\n\t+\
    \ Negative: -1 (e.g. \"surprised\", \"overwhelmed\", \"killed\", \"fierce fighting\"\
    , \"defeat\", \"destruction\", \"annihilated\")\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context\
    \ of each token is analyzed by examining the surrounding tokens. For example,\
    \ the token \"surprised\" is preceded by \"the British camp\" and \"overwhelmed\"\
    \ is followed by \"and almost the whole of the garrison killed\". This context\
    \ is negative, so the sentiment score is adjusted accordingly.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens. The score is predominantly negative due to the presence\
    \ of negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: The\
    \ overall sentiment score is not close to zero, so the text is not classified\
    \ as \"neutral\".\n6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific\
    \ knowledge or machine learning models.\n\nBased on the rules, the overall sentiment\
    \ of the text is negative, so I classify the input text as \"negative\"."
