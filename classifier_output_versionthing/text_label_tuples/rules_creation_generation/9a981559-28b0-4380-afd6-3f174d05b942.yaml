- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Except when the assaulting troops are already in\
    \ position, it will be necessary to choose Positions of Assembly and of Deployment,\
    \ and to precede the advance in the preliminary stages by lines of scouts, ahead\
    \ and on the flanks, within 100 yards of the following troops. On arrival at the\
    \ jumping-off place these advanced scouts will await the arrival of the assaulting\
    \ force, and they should be directed to mark the ground for the various units.\
    \ A scout from each Forward Platoon can thus mark the inner flank on which his\
    \ Platoon will rest, and the direction of the whole line will be assured.The troops\
    \ will usually advance, during the earlier {153} stages, in shallow columns on\
    \ narrow frontages, at deploying intervals, and may maintain this formation until\
    \ the halted line of scouts is reached. Owing to the frequent necessity for halts\
    \ to correct intervals, etc., and the inherent difficulties of movements by night\
    \ in open formations, no greater rate than 1 mile an hour can be counted on. When\
    \ several objectives are in view a corresponding series of Positions of Assembly\
    \ and Deployment will be required, and care must be taken that the various advancing\
    \ forces do not converge.Owing to the difficulty of recognition, a distinguishing\
    \ mark will usually be worn by the troops engaged, a watchword will usually be\
    \ adopted and made known to all ranks, and the commander and staff should wear\
    \ easily distinguishable badges. If hostile patrols are encountered it is essential\
    \ that they should be silenced, and any one encountered who is deficient of the\
    \ badge and ignorant of the watchword should be similarly treated.\"\"\""

- content: 'Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as "negative".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases. The text does not contain any obvious positive or negative sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. The text appears
    to be a military instruction manual, which is a common domain-specific topic.
    The language used is formal and objective, without any emotional tone.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since the text does not contain
    any sentiment-bearing words or phrases, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so it is not necessary to prioritize any particular sentiment.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain any special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is not updated or refined based on this input
    text, as it is a neutral text.


    Overall, the input text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain
    any sentiment-bearing words or phrases, and the language used is formal and objective.'
