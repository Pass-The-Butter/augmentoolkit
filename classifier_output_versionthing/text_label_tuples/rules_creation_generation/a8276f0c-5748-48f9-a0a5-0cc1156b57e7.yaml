    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"As long as the ancient masses marched forward, they\
    \ did not lose a man and no one lay down to avoid the combat. Dash lasted up to\
    \ the time of stopping; the run was short in every case. In modern masses, in\
    \ French masses especially, the march can be continued, but the mass loses while\
    \ marching under fire. Moral pressure, continually exerted during a long advance,\
    \ stops one-half of the combatants on the way. To-day, above all in France, man\
    \ protests against such use of his life. The Frenchman wants to fight, to return\
    \ blow for blow. If he is not allowed to, this is what happens. It happened to\
    \ Napoleon's masses. Let us take Wagram, where his mass was not repulsed. Out\
    \ of twenty-two thousand men, three thousand to fifteen hundred reached the position.\
    \ Certainly the position was not carried by them, but by the material and moral\
    \ effect of a battery of one hundred pieces, cavalry, etc., etc. Were the nineteen\
    \ thousand missing men disabled? No. Seven out of twenty-two, a third, an enormous\
    \ proportion may have been hit. What became of the twelve thousand unaccounted\
    \ for? They had lain down on the road, had played dummy in order not to go on\
    \ to the end. In the confused mass of a column of deployed battalions, surveillance,\
    \ difficult enough in a column at normal distances, is impossible. Nothing is\
    \ easier than dropping out through inertia; nothing more common.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.\n\
    \n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify sentiment-bearing words or phrases:\n\t\
    + \"lose\", \"avoid\", \"stop\", \"protest\", \"fight\", \"return\", \"blow\"\
    , \"repulsed\", \"disabled\", \"hit\", \"dummy\", \"inertia\", \"common\" (mostly\
    \ negative)\n\t+ \"march\", \"continue\", \"fight\", \"return\" (neutral or positive)\n\
    * Assign sentiment scores:\n\t+ Negative: -1 (e.g., \"lose\", \"avoid\", \"stop\"\
    , \"protest\", \"disabled\", \"hit\", \"dummy\", \"inertia\", \"common\")\n\t\
    + Neutral: 0 (e.g., \"march\", \"continue\", \"fight\", \"return\")\n\n**Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context of each token:\n\t+ \"lose\" is preceded\
    \ by \"did not lose a man\", which is negative, so adjust the sentiment score\
    \ to -1.5.\n\t+ \"stop\" is preceded by \"stops one-half of the combatants\",\
    \ which is negative, so adjust the sentiment score to -1.5.\n\t+ \"protest\" is\
    \ preceded by \"man protests against such use of his life\", which is negative,\
    \ so adjust the sentiment score to -1.5.\n\t+ \"fight\" is preceded by \"The Frenchman\
    \ wants to fight\", which is positive, so adjust the sentiment score to 0.5.\n\
    \t+ \"return\" is preceded by \"return blow for blow\", which is positive, so\
    \ adjust the sentiment score to 0.5.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of individual\
    \ tokens:\n\t+ -1.5 (lose) + -1.5 (stop) + -1.5 (protest) + 0.5 (fight) + 0.5\
    \ (return) = -3\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Since the overall sentiment score\
    \ is negative, classify the text as \"negative\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\
    \n* No special cases apply in this text.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The\
    \ model's performance is monitored and adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBased on the rules, the input text is classified as \"negative\"."
