    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The British people at home have taken comfort in\
    \ assuming that, as no supplies can get to the Boers, the war will be brought\
    \ to a speedy end. Deluded people! So long as there is a trek-ox and a sack of\
    \ mealies in the Transvaal the Boers will be sufficiently supplied to carry on\
    \ the war. They carry no store wagons, they issue no rations; but occasionally\
    \ an ox is slaughtered, and each man hangs up a piece of the beef until it is\
    \ dried. He sticks that into his pocket, with some bread made of corn, if he cannot\
    \ get better, and he is perfectly content.I asked General de la Rey where he expected\
    \ to get his supplies after he left Pretoria, and he remarked quietly, as if without\
    \ humorous intention, \u201COh, the English are bringing in enough for both armies.\u201D\
    [Illustration: A soldier with three months\u2019 provisions.]He had warrant, too;\
    \ for I know of many cases where, as the supplies of a command were getting low,\
    \ they went out and captured a wagon-train or a supply-train on the railroad,\
    \ and replenished their larders. General de Wet has kept his commands for many\
    \ months in rations, clothing, and other necessaries of war from the supplies\
    \ of the enemy.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"positive\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words and punctuation marks are removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains\
    \ sentiment-bearing words and phrases, such as \"comfort\", \"deluded\", \"sufficiently\
    \ supplied\", \"perfectly content\", and \"warrant\". These words and phrases\
    \ are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* \"comfort\" and \"perfectly content\" are\
    \ positive (+1 each)\n\t* \"deluded\" is negative (-1)\n\t* \"sufficiently supplied\"\
    \ and \"warrant\" are neutral (0 each)\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of\
    \ the sentiment-bearing words and phrases is analyzed. For example, \"deluded\"\
    \ is preceded by \"Deluded people!\", which is a negative context, so the sentiment\
    \ score for \"deluded\" is decreased by 0.5 to -1.5.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens. The score is:\n\t+ Positive: +1 (comfort) + 1 (perfectly\
    \ content) - 1.5 (deluded) = +0.5\n\t+ Neutral: 0 (sufficiently supplied) + 0\
    \ (warrant) = 0\n5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is positive\
    \ (+0.5), so the text is classified as \"positive\".\n\nNote that the text also\
    \ contains some neutral and negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases, but\
    \ the overall sentiment is positive due to the prevalence of positive sentiment-bearing\
    \ words and phrases."
