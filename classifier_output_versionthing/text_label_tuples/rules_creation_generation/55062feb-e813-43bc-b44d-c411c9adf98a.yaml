- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"A well-established staff does not always result\
    \ from a good system of education for the young aspirants; for a man may be a\
    \ good mathematician and a fine scholar, without being a good warrior. The staff\
    \ should always possess sufficient consideration and prerogative to be sought\
    \ for by the officers of the several arms, and to draw together, in this way,\
    \ men who are already known by their aptitude for war. Engineer and artillery\
    \ officers will no longer oppose the staff, if they reflect that it will open\
    \ to them a more extensive field for immediate distinction, and that it will eventually\
    \ be made up exclusively of the officers of those two corps who may be placed\
    \ at the disposal of the commanding general, and who are the most capable of directing\
    \ the operations of war.\"\"At the beginning of the wars of the Revolution,\"\
    \ says this able historian elsewhere, \"in the French army the general staff,\
    \ which is essential for directing the operations of war, had neither instruction\
    \ nor experience.\" The several adjutant-generals attached to the army of Italy\
    \ were so utterly incompetent, that Napoleon became prejudiced against the existing\
    \ staff-corps, and virtually destroyed it, drawing his staff-officers from the\
    \ other corps of the army. In his earlier wars, a large portion of staff duties\
    \ were assigned to the engineers; but in his later campaigns the officers of this\
    \ corps were particularly required for the sieges carried on in Germany and Spain,\
    \ and considerable difficulty was encountered in finding suitable officers for\
    \ staff duty. Some of the defects of the first French staff-corps were remedied\
    \ in the latter part of Napoleon's career, and in 1818 it was reorganized by Marshal\
    \ Saint-Cyr, and a special school established for its instruction.\"\"\""

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"good\" (positive)\n\t+ \"fine\" (positive)\n\t+ \"aptitude for\
    \ war\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"more extensive field\" (positive)\n\t+ \"essential\"\
    \ (positive)\n\t+ \"incompetent\" (negative)\n\t+ \"prejudiced\" (negative)\n\t\
    + \"destroyed\" (negative)\n\t+ \"difficulty\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"remedied\" (positive)\n\
    \t+ \"reorganized\" (positive)\n* Assigned sentiment scores:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\
    \t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the\
    \ context of each token:\n\t+ \"good\" is preceded by \"well-established\" (positive\
    \ context), so increased the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"fine\" is preceded\
    \ by \"scholarly\" (positive context), so increased the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\
    \t+ \"incompetent\" is preceded by \"utterly\" (negative context), so decreased\
    \ the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"prejudiced\" is preceded by \"became\" (neutral\
    \ context), so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"destroyed\" is preceded by \"virtually\"\
    \ (negative context), so decreased the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"difficulty\"\
    \ is preceded by \"encountered\" (neutral context), so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"\
    remedied\" is preceded by \"some\" (neutral context), so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"\
    reorganized\" is preceded by \"in\" (neutral context), so no adjustment.\n\n**Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation**\n\n* Calculated the overall sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +2.5\n\
    \t+ Negative: -2.5\n* Since the overall sentiment score is close to zero, classified\
    \ the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* No conflicting sentiment-bearing\
    \ words or phrases were found.\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* No special cases\
    \ like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language were detected.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\
    \n* No updates or refinements were necessary for this text.\n\nThe final classification\
    \ is \"neutral\"."
