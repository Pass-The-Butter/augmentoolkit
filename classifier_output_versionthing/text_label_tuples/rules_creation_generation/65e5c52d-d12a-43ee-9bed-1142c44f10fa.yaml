- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The third method, of retreating along several parallel\
    \ roads, is excellent when the roads are sufficiently near each other. But, if\
    \ they are quite distant, one wing separated from the center and from the other\
    \ wing may be compromised if the enemy attacks it in force and compels it to stand\
    \ on the defensive. The Prussian army moving from Magdeburg toward the Oder, in\
    \ 1806, gives an example of this kind.The fourth method, which consists in following\
    \ concentric roads, is undoubtedly the best if the troops are distant from each\
    \ other when the retreat is ordered. Nothing can be better, in such a case, than\
    \ to unite the forces; and the concentric retreat is the only method of effecting\
    \ this.The fifth method indicated is nothing else than the famous system of eccentric\
    \ lines, which I have attributed to Bulow, and have opposed so warmly in the earlier\
    \ editions of my works, because I thought I could not be mistaken either as to\
    \ the sense of his remarks on the subject or as to the object of his system. I\
    \ gathered from his definition that he recommended to a retreating army, moving\
    \ from any given position, to separate into parts and pursue diverging roads,\
    \ with the double object of withdrawing more readily from the enemy in pursuit\
    \ and of arresting his march by threatening his flanks and his line of communications.\
    \ I found great fault with the system, for the simple reason that a beaten army\
    \ is already weak enough, without absurdly still further dividing its forces and\
    \ strength in presence of a victorious enemy.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed. Stop words are also removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases,
    but they are mostly neutral or objective. For example, "excellent", "compelling",
    "undoubtedly", "better", etc. are all neutral.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is mostly neutral, discussing
    military strategies and tactics. There are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases
    that would significantly impact the sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is close to zero, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain sarcasm, irony, or figurative
    language that would require special handling.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is updated and refined based on the input
    text, but the classification remains neutral.


    The text is a neutral discussion of military strategies and tactics, without any
    strong positive or negative sentiment.'
