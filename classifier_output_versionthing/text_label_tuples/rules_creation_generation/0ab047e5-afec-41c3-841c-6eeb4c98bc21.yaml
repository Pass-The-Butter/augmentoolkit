- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"... It is there that I had time to admire the coolness\
    \ of my brave Captain Daguerre, advancing on a mare under the enemy's eyes, and\
    \ observing imperturbable, like a tourist, all the movements of our opponents.\"\
    I will always pay homage to his calm and collected bravery....\"Remarks by the\
    \ colonel.\"Did not Captain Daguerre change the bugle call 'Retreat,' ordered\
    \ by ---- to the bugle call 'Forward?'\"Answer of Captain P----\"In fact, when\
    \ protected in the wood by pieces of wall we were firing on the Russians, we heard\
    \ behind us the bugle sounding 'Retreat' at the order of ----. At this moment\
    \ my captain, indignant, ordered 'Forward' sounded to reestablish confidence which\
    \ had been shaken by the distraction or by the inadvertance of ----.\"5. The Battle\
    \ of InkermannExtract from the correspondence of Colonel Ardant du Picq.First:\
    \ Letter sent from Lyon, March 21, 1869, by Major de G----, 17th Line Regiment.\"\
    ... The 1st Battalion of the 7th Light Regiment had hardly arrived close to the\
    \ telegraph when it received a new order to rush to the help of the English army,\
    \ which, too weak to hold such a large army, had been broken in the center of\
    \ its line and driven back on its camps.\"The 1st Battalion of the 7th Light Regiment,\
    \ Major Vaissier, had the honor to arrive first in the presence of the Russians,\
    \ after moving three kilometers on the run. Received by the enthusiastic cheers\
    \ of the English, it formed for battle, then carried away by burning cries of\
    \ 'Forward, with the bayonet' from its brave major it threw itself headlong, on\
    \ the Russian columns, which broke.\"For two hours the 1st Battalion of the 7th\
    \ Light Regiment, a battalion of the 6th Line Regiment, four companies of the\
    \ 3rd Battalion of foot chasseurs, five companies of Algerian chasseurs held the\
    \ head of the Russian army which continued to debouch in massed columns from the\
    \ ravine and plateau of Inkermann.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "positive".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases such
    as "brave", "calm", "collected", "indignant", "forward", and "with the bayonet".
    These words have positive sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of these sentiment-bearing words and phrases
    is analyzed. For example, "brave" is preceded by "my Captain Daguerre" and "indignant"
    is preceded by "my captain". These contexts are positive, so the sentiment scores
    are increased.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive due to the
    prevalence of positive sentiment-bearing words and phrases.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language, so no special handling is required.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously updated and refined to improve
    accuracy.


    The text is classified as "positive" because it contains numerous positive sentiment-bearing
    words and phrases, and the context of these words is also positive.'
