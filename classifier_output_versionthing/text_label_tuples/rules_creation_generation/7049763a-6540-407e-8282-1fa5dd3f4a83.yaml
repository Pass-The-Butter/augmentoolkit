- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Even the resistance of an ordinary Division of 8000\
    \ to 10,000 men of all arms even opposed to an enemy considerably superior in\
    \ numbers, will last several hours, if the advantages of country are not too preponderating,\
    \ and if the enemy is only a little, or not at all, superior in numbers, the combat\
    \ will last half a day. A Corps of three or four Divisions will prolong it to\
    \ double the time; an Army of 80,000 or 100,000 to three or four times. Therefore\
    \ the masses may be left to themselves for that length of time, and no separate\
    \ combat takes place if within that time other forces can be brought up, whose\
    \ co-operation mingles then at once into one stream with the results of the combat\
    \ which has taken place.These calculations are the result of experience; but it\
    \ is important to us at the same time to characterise more particularly the moment\
    \ of the decision, and consequently the termination.CHAPTER VII. DECISION OF THE\
    \ COMBATNo battle is decided in a single moment, although in every battle there\
    \ arise moments of crisis, on which the result depends. The loss of a battle is,\
    \ therefore, a gradual falling of the scale. But there is in every combat a point\
    \ of time (*)(*) Under the then existing conditions of armament   understood.\
    \ This point is of supreme importance, as   practically the whole conduct of a\
    \ great battle depends on a   correct solution of this question--viz., How long\
    \ can a   given command prolong its resistance? If this is incorrectly   answered\
    \ in practice--the whole manoeuvre depending on it   may collapse--e.g., Kouroupatkin\
    \ at Liao-Yang, September   1904.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the text.


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the text, so no adjustments
    are made to the sentiment scores.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    * The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing words or phrases are
    found.


    **Handling Ambiguity**


    * The overall sentiment score is 0, so the text is classified as "neutral".


    **Handling Special Cases**


    * No special cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language are detected.


    **Continuous Improvement**


    * The model''s performance is monitored, and the rules are adjusted as needed
    to improve accuracy.


    The input text appears to be a passage from a military strategy book, discussing
    the duration of battles and the importance of correct decision-making. The text
    does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases, and the language is formal
    and objective. Therefore, the text is classified as "neutral".'
