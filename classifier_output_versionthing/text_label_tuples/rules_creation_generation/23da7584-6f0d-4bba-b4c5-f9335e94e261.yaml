- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"CHANGES IN METHOD.--The principles which underlie\
    \ the Art of War would thus appear to be based on constant factors, but the methods\
    \ of their application are susceptible to change, for in their application the\
    \ principles are subject to the influence of successive inventions. Gunpowder\
    \ abolished the bow and arrow and the knight in armour; the bayonet affixed to\
    \ the musket superseded the pike; the rifle outranged the musket; the breech-loader\
    \ and the magazine attachment progressively increased the rate of fire; smokeless\
    \ powder rendered a firing line almost invisible; the flat trajectory of the small-arms\
    \ bullet increased the danger-zone in an advance; the increased power, mobility,\
    \ and accuracy of the field gun[4] rendered certain {22} formations obsolete in\
    \ the attack; the general advance in the rate and accuracy of fire from rifles,\
    \ machine guns, and artillery made attack on a strongly organised position possible\
    \ only when surprise in the time and place of the thrust neutralises the advantages\
    \ of the defence, or when an overwhelming barrage of shells and bullets covers\
    \ the advance and smothers the enemy's resistance. The advent of a third service,\
    \ by the addition of the Air to the Sea and Land Services, increased the facilities\
    \ for reconnaissance[5] and added to the difficulties of concealing movement during\
    \ the hours of daylight. These and similar influences have brought about changes\
    \ in certain respects, amongst which the most pronounced is the increased use\
    \ of field entrenchments, and tactical methods have been evolved to meet the necessities\
    \ of the case, or modified to suit the new requirements.[6]\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"neutral\".\n\n\
    Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words or phrases are\
    \ identified, and sentiment scores are assigned:\n\t* \"good\", \"great\", \"\
    increased\", \"progressive\", \"increased\", \"added\" (positive)\n\t* \"abolished\"\
    , \"superseded\", \"out-ranged\", \"increased\", \"rendered\", \"made\" (neutral)\n\
    \t* \"neutralises\", \"smothers\" (negative)\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context\
    \ of each token is analyzed, and sentiment scores are adjusted:\n\t* \"increased\"\
    \ is preceded by \"progressive\" and \"increased\", so its sentiment score is\
    \ increased by 0.5.\n\t* \"rendered\" is followed by \"certain\", so its sentiment\
    \ score is decreased by 0.5.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment\
    \ score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens:\n\
    \t* Positive: +1 (good, great, increased, progressive, added)\n\t* Neutral: 0\
    \ (abolished, superseded, out-ranged, increased, rendered, made)\n\t* Negative:\
    \ -1 (neutralises, smothers)\n\t* The overall sentiment score is 0, which is close\
    \ to neutral.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: Since the overall sentiment score is close\
    \ to zero, the text is classified as \"neutral\".\n6. Handling Special Cases:\
    \ No special cases are identified in this text.\n7. Continuous Improvement: The\
    \ model is continuously updated and refined to improve accuracy.\n\nThe input\
    \ text discusses changes in military tactics and strategies, highlighting the\
    \ evolution of warfare and the importance of adaptability. While it mentions some\
    \ negative aspects, such as the need to neutralize the enemy's defense or smother\
    \ their resistance, the overall tone is neutral, focusing on the development of\
    \ new methods and technologies."
