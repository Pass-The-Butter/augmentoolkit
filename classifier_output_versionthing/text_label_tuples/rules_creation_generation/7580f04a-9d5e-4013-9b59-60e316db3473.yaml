- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"But even this decision of the total combat has only\
    \ a relative meaning of many different gradations, according as the force over\
    \ which the victory has been gained forms a more or less great and important part\
    \ of the whole. The lost battle of a corps may be repaired by the victory of the\
    \ Army. Even the lost battle of an Army may not only be counterbalanced by the\
    \ gain of a more important one, but converted into a fortunate event (the two\
    \ days of Kulm, August 29 and 30, 1813(*)). No one can doubt this; but it is just\
    \ as clear that the weight of each victory (the successful issue of each total\
    \ combat) is so much the more substantial the more important the part conquered,\
    \ and that therefore the possibility of repairing the loss by subsequent events\
    \ diminishes in the same proportion. In another place we shall have to examine\
    \ this more in detail; it suffices for the present to have drawn attention to\
    \ the indubitable existence of this progression.(*) Refers to the destruction\
    \ of Vandamme's column, which   had been sent unsupported to intercept the retreat\
    \ of the   Austrians and Prussians from Dresden--but was forgotten by   Napoleon.--EDITOR.If\
    \ we now add lastly to these two considerations the third, which is, that if the\
    \ persistent use of forces in tactics always shifts the great result to the end\
    \ of the whole act, law of the simultaneous use of the forces in Strategy, on\
    \ the contrary, lets the principal result (which need not be the final one) take\
    \ place almost always at the commencement of the great (or whole) act, then in\
    \ these three results we have grounds sufficient to find strategic reserves always\
    \ more superfluous, always more useless, always more dangerous, the more general\
    \ their destination.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed. Stop words like "the", "and", etc. are also removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "victory", "gain", "fortunate",
    "substantial", etc. which have positive sentiment. However, it also contains words
    like "lost", "battle", "defeat", etc. which have negative sentiment. The overall
    sentiment score is neutral.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is more focused on military strategy
    and tactics, which makes the sentiment more neutral.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, so the text
    is classified as "neutral".

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain any special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously updated and refined to improve
    accuracy, but in this case, the text is classified as "neutral" based on the rules
    applied.


    Note that the text is a passage from a military strategy book and is written in
    a formal and objective tone, which contributes to its neutral sentiment.'
