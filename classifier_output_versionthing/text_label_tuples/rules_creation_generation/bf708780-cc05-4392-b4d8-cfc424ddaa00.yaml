- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Of the many things a modern army requires which are\
    \ to be found only in a few special places, and those, most of them, out of Europe,\
    \ the most important of all is petrol. It is obviously of capital importance for\
    \ air work, and where you have a number of good roads, as in the Western field\
    \ of operations, it is almost as important for transport work.Now it so happens\
    \ that petrol is not found in Western Europe at all. The European supply as a\
    \ whole is limited, and is in the main confined to Galicia, Roumania, and Russia.\
    \ The Asiatic and American supply is only available to Austria-Hungary and Germany\
    \ by way of the ocean, and the ocean is closed to them. Russian supply, of course,\
    \ they cannot obtain. Galician supply swings back and forth now in the possession\
    \ of the Austrian and now in that of the Russian Army.There remains only Roumania,\
    \ and though Roumania is neutral it is doubtful or rather nearly certain that\
    \ no sufficient supplies are coming into the Germanic Powers from that source.\
    \ This is up to the moment of writing the chief effect of the British naval superiority,\
    \ to which I will next turn.(7) Most of the things that were said in time of peace\
    \ about the effect of naval superiority or \u201Ccommand of the sea\u201D have\
    \ proved true. The blockade of the inferior naval powers is nearly complete--though\
    \ it must be remembered that they have an exceedingly limited coastline, and that\
    \ the problem will be very different against a large fleet possessed of many ports\
    \ upon an extended coastline.Further, the submarine has not proved itself as formidable\
    \ against men-of-war as some thought, and the superiority of large craft is still\
    \ admitted. On the other hand, it has been shown that a few hostile cruisers could\
    \ continue to hold the seas for a much longer period than was imagined, and permanently\
    \ to threaten commerce.\"\"\""
