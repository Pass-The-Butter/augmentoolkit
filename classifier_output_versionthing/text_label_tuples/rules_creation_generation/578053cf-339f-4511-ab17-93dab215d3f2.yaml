- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\

    \ hegemony, being of kindred blood and speech, and which would in special points\
    \ admit actual economic or political control by Germans.Buffer Polish States,\
    \ which Prussia might erect dependent on herself and as a barrier against Russia.Holland,\
    \ a special case. Kindred in speech. Not actually annexed, perhaps, but allowed\
    \ only a quasi-independent position with German control, veiled, in the two principal\
    \ ports, and facilities for German Navy. Also included in any economic policy.Districts\
    \ in no way kindred to Germanic peoples, but to be annexed, or at any rate directly\
    \ controlled in order to command the Balkans, to dominate Constantinople, and\
    \ to get a passage to the \xC6gean Sea.District which German Empire might annex,\
    \ both on account of its German elements in population, and on account of controlling\
    \ the Baltic.]One may sum up and say that Germany and Austria expect from victory\
    \ a Europe in which all that is German-speaking and already within their moral\
    \ influence shall support their power over the world, that power not coming in\
    \ the shape of annexations, save at one or two selected points.Once on the North\
    \ Sea, and once having broken British maritime supremacy, Central Europe would\
    \ leave the future to do its work, content in the East with dominating the Balkans\
    \ and reaching the \xC6gean Sea, and with permanently holding back the further\
    \ advance of Russia.[Illustration: MAP IV. EUROPE REMODELLED BY THE ALLIES1. To\
    \ retain their present boundaries: Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland,\
    \ Norway, Sweden.2. The Germanic Peoples: with the Catholic South leaning upon\
    \ Vienna and a large autonomy to individual States.3. France: with Alsace-Lorraine.4.\
    \ Poland: Quasi-independent, but a holding of Russia.5. Czechs: Quasi-independent,\
    \ but probably still a holding of Vienna.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"dependent\", \"annexed\", \"controlled\", \"dominate\", \"power\"\
    , \"annexations\", \"broken\", \"held back\" (negative)\n\t+ \"German-speaking\"\
    , \"moral influence\", \"support\", \"power\" (positive)\n* Assigned sentiment\
    \ scores:\n\t+ Negative tokens: -1 each\n\t+ Positive tokens: +1 each\n\t+ Neutral\
    \ tokens: 0\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\
    \t+ \"dependent\" is preceded by \"which would be\" and followed by \"on herself\
    \ and as a barrier against Russia\", which is negative, so adjust the sentiment\
    \ score to -1.5.\n\t+ \"annexed\" is preceded by \"to be\" and followed by \"\
    or at any rate directly controlled\", which is negative, so adjust the sentiment\
    \ score to -1.5.\n\t+ \"dominate\" is preceded by \"to command\" and followed\
    \ by \"the Balkans, to dominate Constantinople, and to get a passage to the \xC6\
    gean Sea\", which is negative, so adjust the sentiment score to -1.5.\n\t+ \"\

    \t+ Sum of sentiment scores: -6\n* Classified the text as \"negative\" since the\

    \ does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so no ambiguity\
    \ is handled.\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* The text does not contain special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language, so no special handling is\
    \ required.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's performance is monitored\
    \ and adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.\n\nThe input text is classified\
    \ as \"negative\" due to the dominant negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases,\
    \ such as \"dependent\", \"annexed\", \"controlled\", \"dominate\", and \"power\"\
