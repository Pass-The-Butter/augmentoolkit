- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The bloody battles of the Alma and Inkermann, by\
    \ giving evidence of the murderous effect of the new fire-arms, naturally led\
    \ me to investigate the changes which it might be necessary to make on this account\
    \ in the tactics for infantry.I shall endeavor to fulfill this task in a few words,\
    \ in order to complete what was published on this point twenty years ago in the\
    \ Summary of the Art of War.The important question of the influence of musketry-fire\
    \ in battles is not new: it dates from the reign of Frederick the Great, and particularly\
    \ from the battle of Mollwitz, which he gained (it was said) because his infantry-soldiers,\
    \ by the use of cylindrical rammers in loading their muskets, were able to fire\
    \ three shots per minute more than their enemies.[55] The discussion which arose\
    \ at this epoch between the partisans of the shallow and deep orders of formation\
    \ for troops is known to all military students.The system of deployed lines in\
    \ three ranks was adopted for the infantry; the cavalry, formed in two ranks,\
    \ and in the order of battle, was deployed upon the wings, or a part was held\
    \ in reserve.The celebrated regulation for maneuvers of 1791 fixed the deployed\
    \ as the only order for battle: it seemed to admit the use of battalion-columns\
    \ doubled on the center only in partial combats,--such as an attack upon an isolated\
    \ post, a village, a forest, or small intrenchments.[56]The insufficient instruction\
    \ in maneuvers of the troops of the Republic forced the generals, who were poor\
    \ tacticians, to employ in battle the system of columns supported by numerous\
    \ skirmishers. Besides this, the nature of the countries which formed the theaters\
    \ of operations--the Vosges, Alps, Pyrenees, and the difficult country of La Vend\xE9\
    e--rendered this the only appropriate system. How would it have been possible\
    \ to attack the camps of Saorgio, Figueras, and Mont-Cenis with deployed regiments?\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "bloody",
    "murderous", "important", and "celebrated", but they are not strong enough to
    dominate the overall sentiment. The text also contains neutral words like "task",
    "order", and "system".

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is primarily focused on military
    tactics and history, which is a neutral topic. The sentiment-bearing words are
    used to describe events and strategies, rather than expressing emotions.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is likely to be close to
    zero, as the text contains both positive and negative sentiment-bearing words,
    but they are balanced out by the neutral context.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model can continue to improve by incorporating
    more data and feedback, but based on the current rules, the text is classified
    as "neutral".'
