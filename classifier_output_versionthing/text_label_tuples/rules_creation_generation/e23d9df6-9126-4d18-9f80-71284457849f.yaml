    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The operations of the detachments an army may send\
    \ out have so important a bearing on the success of a campaign, that the duty\
    \ of determining their strength and the proper occasions for them is one of the\
    \ greatest and most delicate responsibilities imposed upon a commander. If nothing\
    \ is more useful in war than a strong detachment opportunely sent out and having\
    \ a good _ensemble_ of operations with the main body, it is equally certain that\
    \ no expedient is more dangerous when inconsiderately adopted. Frederick the Great\
    \ regarded it as one of the essential qualities of a general to know how to make\
    \ his adversary send out many detachments, either with the view of destroying\
    \ them in detail or of attacking the main body during their absence.The division\
    \ of armies into numerous detachments has sometimes been carried to so great an\
    \ extent, and with such poor results, that many persons now believe it better\
    \ to have none of them. It is undoubtedly much safer and more agreeable for an\
    \ army to be kept in a single mass; but it is a thing at times impossible or incompatible\
    \ with gaining a complete or even considerable success. The essential point in\
    \ this matter is to send out as few detachments as possible.There are several\
    \ kinds of detachments.1. There are large corps dispatched to a distance from\
    \ the zone of   operations of the main army, in order to make diversions of greater\
    \   or less importance.2. There are large detachments made in the zone of operations\
    \ to   cover important points of this zone, to carry on a siege, to guard   a\
    \ secondary base, or to protect the line of operations if   threatened.3. There\
    \ are large detachments made upon the front of operations,   in face of the enemy,\
    \ to act in concert with the main body in some   combined operation.\"\"\""

    \ Here's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\

    , \"essential\" (neutral)\n\t+ No overtly positive or negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words or phrases.\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each\
    \ token:\n\t+ No significant contextual adjustments to sentiment scores.\n\n**Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation**\n\n* Calculated the overall sentiment score: 0 (neutral)\n\n**Handling\
