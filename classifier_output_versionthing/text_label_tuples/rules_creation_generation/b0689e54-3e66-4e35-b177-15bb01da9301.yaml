- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The Germans, who, after the Russian revolution, were\
    \ enabled to withdraw the best elements from their divisions on their Eastern\
    \ Front, made, in June and July, 1917, a frequent use of their _Stosstruppen_\
    \ in counter-attacks in Artois, and in desperate and daily attacks on the Chemin\
    \ des Dames, but the result was far from expectation.The _Stosstruppen_, obliged,\
    \ like the ordinary troops, to attack in too serried ranks, offer a splendid target\
    \ to artillery and machine-guns and, nine times out of ten, their rush is stopped\
    \ before they can engage in a hand-to-hand fight.[Illustration: La BovelleMay\
    \ 5, 1917--10.30 A.M.]We wonder what the German divisions on the Russian Front\
    \ will be able to accomplish without their best and strongest elements when the\
    \ Russian Army rallies and re-enters the war in earnest.=3. Mission and use of\
    \ the infantry in a division.= We have stated that a division includes three or\
    \ four regiments. We will now dwell on the disposition of a division comprising\
    \ two brigades of two regiments each. It seems certain that this is the type that\
    \ will be adopted by the American Army, which possesses a sufficient number of\
    \ men for this normal constitution of a division._Front of a division._ The front\
    \ of a division in trench warfare is very variable in extent. The occupation of\
    \ strong intrenchments, enabling the reserves to be sheltered from the enemy\u2019\
    s fire, allows of the extension of the front, especially if the army remains on\
    \ the defensive.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words and punctuation marks
    were removed. Stop words were also removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "desperate",
    "splendid", and "certain", but they are not strong enough to dominate the overall
    sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is primarily descriptive and informative,
    with no strong sentiment-bearing phrases or words that would influence the sentiment
    score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is close to zero, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model''s performance is not affected by this text,
    as it is a historical and informative text with no strong sentiment.


    The text is primarily a historical account of military tactics and strategies,
    with no strong emotional tone or sentiment. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
