- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Let us accompany the novice to the battle-field.\
    \ As we approach, the thunder of the cannon becoming plainer and plainer is soon\
    \ followed by the howling of shot, which attracts the attention of the inexperienced.\
    \ Balls begin to strike the ground close to us, before and behind. We hasten to\
    \ the hill where stands the General and his numerous Staff. Here the close striking\
    \ of the cannon balls and the bursting of shells is so frequent that the seriousness\
    \ of life makes itself visible through the youthful picture of imagination. Suddenly\
    \ some one known to us falls--a shell strikes amongst the crowd and causes some\
    \ involuntary movements--we begin to feel that we are no longer perfectly at ease\
    \ and collected; even the bravest is at least to some degree confused. Now, a\
    \ step farther into the battle which is raging before us like a scene in a theatre,\
    \ we get to the nearest General of Division; here ball follows ball, and the noise\
    \ of our own guns increases the confusion. From the General of Division to the\
    \ Brigadier. He, a man of acknowledged bravery, keeps carefully behind a rising\
    \ ground, a house, or a tree--a sure sign of increasing danger. Grape rattles\
    \ on the roofs of the houses and in the fields; cannon balls howl over us, and\
    \ plough the air in all directions, and soon there is a frequent whistling of\
    \ musket balls. A step farther towards the troops, to that sturdy infantry which\
    \ for hours has maintained its firmness under this heavy fire; here the air is\
    \ filled with the hissing of balls which announce their proximity by a short sharp\
    \ noise as they pass within an inch of the ear, the head, or the breast.\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* The input text is split into\
    \ individual words or tokens.\n* Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words are removed.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Tokens with sentiment-bearing\
    \ words or phrases are identified:\n\t+ \"falls\" (negative)\n\t+ \"confused\"\
    \ (negative)\n\t+ \"danger\" (negative)\n\t+ \"hissing\" (negative)\n\t+ \"proximity\"\
    \ (neutral)\n* Tokens without sentiment-bearing words or phrases are assigned\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Contextual analysis\
    \ is performed for each token:\n\t+ \"falls\" is preceded by \"some one known\
    \ to us\", which is neutral, so no adjustment is made.\n\t+ \"confused\" is preceded\
    \ by \"we begin to feel that we are no longer perfectly at ease and collected\"\
    , which is negative, so the sentiment score is decreased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"danger\"\
    \ is preceded by \"He, a man of acknowledged bravery, keeps carefully behind a\
    \ rising ground, a house, or a tree\", which is neutral, so no adjustment is made.\n\
    \t+ \"hissing\" is preceded by \"the sound of musket balls\", which is negative,\
    \ so the sentiment score is decreased by 0.5.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n\
    * The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens:\n\t+ Positive: 0\n\t+ Negative: -2.5\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\
    \n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* The overall sentiment score is negative, so the\
    \ text is classified as \"negative\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* No special\
    \ cases are identified in this text.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's\
    \ performance is monitored, and the rules are refined as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBased on the analysis, the input text is classified as \"negative\"."
