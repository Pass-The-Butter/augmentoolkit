    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In overcoming the Boers Great Britain had a problem\
    \ of appalling magnitude. Her soldiers were to be transported from the ends of\
    \ the earth to the Cape, and then to march as far as from New York to Denver before\
    \ they could reach the enemy\u2019s capital. Their line of communication was to\
    \ be guarded in force at every bridge, trestle, and causeway for the whole of\
    \ that immense distance. Cape Colony, the base of operations, was itself almost\
    \ a hostile country. Three besieged British garrisons were to be relieved, and\
    \ they required three diverging armies of rescue. The keeping up of the soldiers\u2019\
    \ spirits over such a prodigious march, and the maintenance of the trains that\
    \ fed them, constituted a problem such as no other army of this century has had\
    \ to face. That the War Office in London did undertake it, and did actually overcome\
    \ the natural obstacles which were more formidable than any fighting force that\
    \ could meet the British in the field, showed a mental comprehension and perspicacity,\
    \ as well as a perfection of organization, that has properly engaged the admiration\
    \ of every strategist in Europe. Whatever blunders of tactics in the field were\
    \ thrown up by incompetent officers, there was a big, clear brain behind it all,\
    \ that knew the immense business, kept it going, saw beyond the diverging armies,\
    \ effected a concentration, captured the capitals of two states, and accomplished\
    \ military results that seemed impossible. The strategy accomplishing all this\
    \ is of the very first order, and is a power which the warrior nations of the\
    \ world must take into account.\"\"\""

- content: 'Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as "positive".


    The text contains several sentiment-bearing words and phrases, such as "appalling
    magnitude", "prodigious march", "natural obstacles", "admiration", and "military
    results that seemed impossible". These words and phrases have a positive sentiment
    score of +1.


    The text also contains phrases that have a positive context, such as "mental comprehension
    and perspicacity", "perfection of organization", and "very first order". These
    phrases have a positive sentiment score of +1.


    The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated by summing up the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens. The text contains many positive sentiment-bearing
    words and phrases, and only a few neutral or negative words. Therefore, the overall
    sentiment score is positive.


    Additionally, the text does not contain any conflicting sentiment-bearing words
    or phrases, and it does not contain any special cases that would require handling,
    such as sarcasm or irony. Therefore, the text can be classified as "positive"
    based on the rules provided.'
