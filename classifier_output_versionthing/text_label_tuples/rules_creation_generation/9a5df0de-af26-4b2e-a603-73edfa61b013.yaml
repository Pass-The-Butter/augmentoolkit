- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"One portion of the old method may still be employed;\
    \ and if, by way of example, it may not be regarded as a fundamental rule to post\
    \ the cavalry on the wings, it may still be a very good arrangement for an army\
    \ of fifty or sixty thousand men, especially when the ground in the center is\
    \ not so suitable for the evolutions of cavalry as that near the extremities.\
    \ It is usual to attach one or two brigades of light cavalry to each infantry\
    \ corps, those of the center being placed in preference to the rear, whilst those\
    \ of the wings are placed upon the flanks. If the reserves of cavalry are sufficiently\
    \ numerous to permit the organization of three corps of this arm, giving one as\
    \ reserve to the center and one to each wing, the arrangement is certainly a good\
    \ one. If that is impossible, this reserve may be formed in two columns, one on\
    \ the right of the left wing and the other on the left of the right wing. These\
    \ columns may thus readily move to any point of the line that may be threatened.[45]The\
    \ artillery of the present day has greater mobility, and may, as formerly, be\
    \ distributed along the front, that of each division remaining near it. It may\
    \ be observed, moreover, that, the organization of the artillery having been greatly\
    \ improved, an advantageous distribution of it may be more readily made; but it\
    \ is a great mistake to scatter it too much. Few precise rules can be laid down\
    \ for the proper distribution of artillery. Who, for example, would dare to advise\
    \ as a rule the filling up of a large gap in a line of battle with one hundred\
    \ pieces of cannon in a single battery without adequate support, as Napoleon did\
    \ successfully at Wagram? I do not desire to go here into much detail with reference\
    \ to the use of this arm, but I will give the following rules:--1. The horse-artillery\
    \ should be placed on such ground that it can move freely in every direction.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words or phrases.
    Some tokens have words like "good", "very", "great", and "advantageous", which
    are positive. Others have words like "mistake", "few", and "not", which are neutral
    or slightly negative. However, the overall sentiment is not strongly positive
    or negative.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed by looking at the
    surrounding tokens. Some tokens are preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, but the context is mostly neutral.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to zero, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously updated and refined to improve
    accuracy.


    Overall, the input text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain
    strong positive or negative sentiment-bearing words or phrases, and the context
    is mostly neutral.'
