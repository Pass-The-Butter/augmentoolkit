- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\

    \ at the mouth of the River Niemen (which the Germans call the Memel), the true\
    \ frontier of the German type runs southward for a short distance until it reaches\
    \ what is called the Region of the Lakes, where the Russian frontier begins to\
    \ turn west. There the boundary turns west also, and begins to run north again,\
    \ nearly reaching the Baltic Sea in the neighbourhood of Dantzig. It then turns\
    \ south by west, goes far west of Thorn and even of Posen, which are Polish towns,\
    \ and comes round not far east of Frankfort-on-Oder. Then it goes south and east\
    \ again, coming right through the middle of German Silesia, but, on reaching the\
    \ mountains that here bound Bohemia, it curls round northwestward again, leaving\
    \ the mountainous part of the barrier of Bohemia all German, but excluding the\
    \ Slavonic true Bohemian people in the centre of that isolated region. The Upper\
    \ Valley of the Elbe is not German. Having thus gone all the way round Bohemia\
    \ proper, the boundaries of the German type run eastward again, very nearly following\
    \ the watershed of the Danube until they strike the March River about thirty miles\
    \ from Vienna. Vienna is thus not a centre, but, like Berlin, an outpost of German\
    \ speech and civilization. From Vienna the true frontier of the German folk runs\
    \ south, more or less corresponding to the existing boundary between Austria and\
    \ Hungary, until it passes the point of Gratz--which counts as German. Thence\
    \ the boundary turns due west again, taking in the greater part of the Tyrol,\
    \ and so to the Swiss frontier and on to the Rhine opposite Belfort. Thence it\
    \ follows the Rhine to a point south of Spiers, and after that follows the existing\
    \ boundaries (excepting Luxembourg), and is confined by the Dutch and Belgian\
    \ frontier and the North and Baltic Seas with the exception of the Danish belt\

- content: 'Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "tortuous", "short", "west",
    "north", "south", "east", "mountainous", "Slavonic", "isolated", "German", "Austrian",
    "Hungarian", "Tyrolean", "Swiss", "Dutch", and "Belgian", which do not have a
    clear positive or negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases
    that would influence the sentiment score of individual tokens.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since the text does not contain
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,
    irony, or figurative language that would require domain-specific knowledge or
    machine learning models.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model is not updated or refined based on new data,
    feedback, or domain-specific knowledge, as the input text does not contain any
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases.


    Therefore, the input text is classified as "neutral".'
