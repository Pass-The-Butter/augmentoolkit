- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The broad column finds proper employment, aside from\
    \ parades, in cases where the terrain or the contemplated deployment requires\
    \ more front than depth. It is also advisable to assemble the widely scattered\
    \ troops in a broad column after an action. The broad column does not lend itself,\
    \ however, to the execution of changes of front by battalion; but should such\
    \ changes of front become necessary, they are always to be executed by company.The\
    \ color is posted between the right and left center companies, in broad column,\
    \ and on the right flank of the third company, in deep column. In action the color\
    \ remains with the company with which it happens to be at the moment.[77] Should\
    \ this company also join the firing line, the color accompanies it; but under\
    \ all circumstances one squad must remain with the color. (Par. 236 German I.\
    \ D. R.). It has been contended that this is a disadvantage, as the enemy can\
    \ direct his fire on the color and the men in its vicinity. If the colors, upon\
    \ which the soldiers have been sworn, are taken into the field, it is always better\
    \ to endure the unavoidable losses incidental to carrying them, and even to expose\
    \ them to capture, than to send them back to a safe place under escort.[78] At\
    \ the Albrechtshaus farm (W\xF6rth) the colors served as rallying points around\
    \ which the disordered skirmishers rapidly assembled.[79][77] In Japan the color\
    \ joins the battalion commander. British  troops leave their colors in their garrisons.\
    \ In Russia and France  the color is carried only by one battalion of each regiment.\"\

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases,
    but they are mostly neutral or objective, describing military tactics and strategies.
    Some examples include "proper employment", "advisable", "necessary", and "better".

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is mostly neutral, describing
    military procedures and strategies. There are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases
    that would significantly impact the sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is close to zero, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain conflicting sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so there is no need to prioritize one over the other.

    6. Handling Special Cases: The text does not contain sarcasm, irony, or figurative
    language that would require special handling.

    7. Continuous Improvement: The model''s performance is not affected by this text,
    as it is a neutral and objective passage.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it describes military tactics
    and strategies in a neutral and objective manner, without expressing any strong
    positive or negative sentiment.'
