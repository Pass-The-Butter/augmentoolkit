- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The second letter was calculated at the least to\
    \ call up in General York's mind all the feelings of bitterness which perhaps\
    \ for some days past had been diminished by the consciousness of his own behaviour\
    \ towards the writer.As the Author entered General York's chamber, the latter\
    \ called out to him, \"Keep off from me; I will have nothing more to do with you;\
    \ your d----d Cossacks have let a letter of Macdonald's pass through them, which\
    \ brings me an order to march on Piktrepohnen, in order there to effect our junction.\
    \ All doubt is now at an end; your troops do not come up; you are too weak; march\
    \ I must, and I must excuse myself from further negotiation, which may cost me\
    \ my head.\" The Author said that be would make no opposition to all this, but\
    \ begged for a candle, as he had letters to show the General, and, as the latter\
    \ seemed still to hesitate, the Author added, \"Your Excellency will not surely\
    \ place me in the embarrassment of departing without having executed my commission.\"\
    \ The General ordered candles, and called in Colonel von Roeder, the chief of\
    \ his staff, from the ante-chamber. The letters were read. After a pause of an\
    \ instant, the General said, \"Clausewitz, you are a Prussian, \"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into\

    \ sentiment-bearing words or phrases are:\n\t+ \"bitterness\" (negative)\n\t+\
    \ \"d----d\" (negative)\n\t+ \"cost me my head\" (negative)\n\t+ \"weak\" (negative)\n\
    \t+ \"excuse myself from further negotiation which may cost me my head\" (negative)\n\
    * The sentiment scores are:\n\t+ \"bitterness\": -1\n\t+ \"d----d\": -1\n\t+ \"\
    cost me my head\": -1\n\t+ \"weak\": -1\n\t+ \"excuse myself from further negotiation\
    \ which may cost me my head\": -1\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* The context\
    \ for each token is analyzed:\n\t+ \"bitterness\" is preceded by \"feelings of\"\
    \ and followed by \"which perhaps for some days past had been diminished\", which\
    \ is a negative context.\n\t+ \"d----d\" is a standalone negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ word.\n\t+ \"cost me my head\" is a standalone negative sentiment-bearing phrase.\n\
    \t+ \"weak\" is a standalone negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\t+ \"excuse myself\
    \ from further negotiation which may cost me my head\" is a standalone negative\
    \ sentiment-bearing phrase.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* The overall sentiment\
    \ score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens:\n\
    \t+ -1 (bitterness) + -1 (d----d) + -1 (cost me my head) + -1 (weak) + -1 (excuse\
    \ myself from further negotiation which may cost me my head) = -5\n\n**Handling\
    \ Ambiguity**\n\n* The overall sentiment score is negative, so the text is classified\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* There are no special cases\
    \ in this text that require handling.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's\
    \ performance is monitored, and the rules are adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBased on the rules, the input text is classified as \"negative\"."
