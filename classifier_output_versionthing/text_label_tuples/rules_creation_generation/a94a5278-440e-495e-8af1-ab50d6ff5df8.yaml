- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The greatest obstacle to infantry reconnaissance\
    \ lies in the fact that its cyclists are confined to good roads; that its mounted\
    \ officers cannot be withdrawn from their appropriate duties except for short\
    \ periods; that, as a rule, orderlies are not available for carrying messages;\
    \ and that, if officers carry messages in person, the reconnaissance is interrupted.\
    \ Infantry patrols, on account of the slowness of their movements, cannot transmit\
    \ messages quickly, and, as a result, such messages frequently arrive too late\
    \ to be of any value. On the other hand, infantry patrols possess an advantage\
    \ in that, by utilizing cover, they can get close to the enemy without being observed.\
    \ The need of local reconnaissance is greater now than it was in the past, because\
    \ troops can no longer change front when deployed, and because those which come\
    \ under hostile fire while in close order formations may, in a short time, suffer\
    \ well-nigh annihilating losses.In the South African war the British infantry\
    \ was frequently placed  in difficult situations by the suddenly delivered fire\
    \ of the Boers  (=Magersfontain=, =Colenso=), which induced it to deploy all of\
    \ its  lines on a wide front at an early moment.The Japanese attached much importance\
    \ to local reconnaissance,  whereas the Russian leaders considered it as something\
    \ unusual, so  that Kuropatkin was finally obliged to prescribe it in army orders.\
    \  \u201CLocal reconnaissance was performed by 20 to 30 infantrymen. These  carefully\
    \ approached our positions in small groups. One man of each  group laid his rifle\
    \ aside and crawled close up to our trenches,  raised his head and observed, while\
    \ three or four of his companions,  whom he had left farther in rear, opened fire\
    \ on the trenches.  Occasionally all of these men threw themselves flat on the\
    \ ground for  protection. This mode of procedure continued for seven hours.\u201D\

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"greatest\" (positive)\n\t+ \"good\" (positive)\n\t+ \"slowness\"\
    \ (negative)\n\t+ \"advantage\" (positive)\n\t+ \"need\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"difficult\"\

    \ Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t+ \"greatest\" is preceded\
    \ by \"obstacle\", which is neutral, so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"good\" is preceded\
    \ by \"roads\", which is neutral, so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"slowness\" is preceded\
    \ by \"infantry patrols\", which is neutral, so no adjustment.\n\t+ ...and so\

    \t+ Positive: +2\n\t+ Negative: -3\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* The overall sentiment score is close to zero, so the text is classified as\
    \ \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* No special cases were identified\
    \ in this text.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's performance is\
    \ monitored and adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.\n\nThe input text is classified\
    \ as \"neutral\" because the sentiment scores are evenly balanced, with no dominant\
    \ positive or negative sentiment."
