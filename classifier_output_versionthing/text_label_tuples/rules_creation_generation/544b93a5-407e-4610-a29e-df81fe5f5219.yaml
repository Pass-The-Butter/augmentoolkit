- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The trust confided to me by a Royal Couple is a fresh\
    \ benefit for which I have to thank the Almighty, as it opens to me an honourable\
    \ occupation, to which Idevote myself. May this occupation be blessed, and may\
    \ the dear little Prince who is now entrusted to my care, some day read this book,\
    \ and be animated by it to deeds like those of his glorious ancestors.Written\
    \ at the Marble Palace, Potsdam, 30th June, 1832.MARIE VON CLAUSEWITZ, Born Countess\
    \ Bruhl, Oberhofmeisterinn to H.R.H. the Princess William.NOTICEI LOOK upon the\
    \ first six books, of which a fair copy has now been made, as only a mass which\
    \ is still in a manner without form, and which has yet to be again revised. In\
    \ this revision the two kinds of War will be everywhere kept more distinctly in\
    \ view, by which all ideas will acquire a clearer meaning, a more precise direction,\
    \ and a closer application. The two kinds of War are, first, those in which the\
    \ object is the OVERTHROW OF THE ENEMY, whether it be that we aim at his destruction,\
    \ politically, or merely at disarming him and forcing him to conclude peace on\
    \ our terms; and next, those in which our object is MERELY TO MAKE SOME CONQUESTS\
    \ ON THE FRONTIERS OF HIS COUNTRY, either for the purpose of retaining them permanently,\
    \ or of turning them to account as matter of exchange in the settlement of a peace.\
    \ Transition from one kind to the other must certainly continue to exist, but\
    \ the completely different nature of the tendencies of the two must everywhere\
    \ appear, and must separate from each other things which are incompatible.\"\"\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"positive\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.\n\
    \n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify sentiment-bearing words or phrases:\n\t\
    + \"fresh benefit\" (positive)\n\t+ \"honourable occupation\" (positive)\n\t+\
    \ \"blessed\" (positive)\n\t+ \"glorious ancestors\" (positive)\n\t+ \"clearer\
    \ meaning\" (positive)\n\t+ \"closer application\" (positive)\n* Assign sentiment\
    \ scores:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context of each token:\n\t+ \"fresh benefit\" is\
    \ preceded by \"a Royal Couple\", which is positive, so increase the sentiment\
    \ score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"honourable occupation\" is preceded by \"opens to me\"\
    , which is neutral, so no adjustment.\n\t+ \"blessed\" is preceded by \"May this\
    \ occupation be\", which is positive, so increase the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\
    \t+ \"glorious ancestors\" is preceded by \"the dear little Prince\", which is\
    \ positive, so increase the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"clearer meaning\" is\
    \ preceded by \"all ideas will acquire\", which is neutral, so no adjustment.\n\
    \t+ \"closer application\" is preceded by \"a more precise direction\", which\
    \ is positive, so increase the sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5\
    \ + 0 + 0.5 = +4\n* Since the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the\
    \ text as \"positive\".\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* The text does not contain\
    \ conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so no need to prioritize.\n\n\
    **Handling Special Cases**\n\n* The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm,\
    \ irony, or figurative language, so no need to handle them.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\
    \n* The model's performance is not evaluated in this example, but it would be\
    \ important to monitor and refine the model over time to improve accuracy.\n\n\
    Overall, the text is classified as \"positive\" due to the prevalence of positive\
    \ sentiment-bearing words and phrases, as well as the positive context in which\
    \ they appear."
