    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The importance of the tactical formations which at\
    \ one time constituted minor tactics has doubtlessly decreased; unfavorable formations,\
    \ in so far as they increase or reduce losses, increase or restrict one\u2019\
    s fire effect, can be offset by the fighting efficiency of the soldier and by\
    \ proper leading. The unfortunate termination of the battle of Jena for the Prussian\
    \ arms, as already mentioned, bears no relation to drill as such. The formations\
    \ in themselves were not at fault, for linear tactics scored the greatest successes\
    \ in the Peninsular war and at Waterloo; and at the Katzbach, Prussian battalions\
    \ of Borke\u2019s Brigade in line overran the French columns. Within certain limits,\
    \ numerical inferiority and lack of fighting efficiency can be offset by leadership.\
    \ But numbers and fighting efficiency will always remain the decisive factors\
    \ for success.The victory of Spicheren was due primarily to the troops and not\
    \ to leadership. This is likewise true of W\xF6rth. The lion\u2019s share in the\
    \ victory of Vionville is certainly due to the fighting efficiency of the gallant\
    \ Brandenburgers. Finally, at St. Privat, the crisis produced by the commanders\
    \ was successfully overcome only by the tenacity of the troops, who maintained\
    \ their positions for hours under the most destructive hostile fire.\"\"\""

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization:\n\t* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n\t* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n2. Sentiment Analysis:\n\t* Identified sentiment-bearing words and phrases:\n\
    \t\t+ \"unfavorable\" (negative)\n\t\t+ \"unfortunate\" (negative)\n\t\t+ \"greatest\
    \ successes\" (positive)\n\t\t+ \"lion's share\" (positive)\n\t\t+ \"tenacity\"\
    \ (positive)\n\t* Assigned sentiment scores:\n\t\t+ \"unfavorable\" and \"unfortunate\"\
    : -1 each\n\t\t+ \"greatest successes\", \"lion's share\", and \"tenacity\": +1\
    \ each\n3. Contextual Analysis:\n\t* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t\t\
    + \"unfavorable\" and \"unfortunate\" are preceded by neutral words, so no adjustment\
    \ needed.\n\t\t+ \"greatest successes\", \"lion's share\", and \"tenacity\" are\
    \ preceded by positive words, so increased their sentiment scores by 0.5 each.\n\
    4. Sentiment Aggregation:\n\t* Calculated the overall sentiment score:\n\t\t+\
    \ -1 (unfavorable) + -1 (unfortunate) + 1.5 (greatest successes) + 1.5 (lion's\
    \ share) + 1.5 (tenacity) = 1\n5. Handling Ambiguity:\n\t* The overall sentiment\
    \ score is positive, so the text is classified as \"positive\".\n6. Handling Special\
    \ Cases:\n\t* None applicable in this case.\n7. Continuous Improvement:\n\t* Not\
    \ applicable in this case, as the model is already following the rules.\n\nThe\
    \ text is primarily discussing military tactics and strategies, and while it mentions\
    \ some negative aspects, the overall tone is neutral, focusing on the importance\
    \ of factors like leadership, numbers, and fighting efficiency."
