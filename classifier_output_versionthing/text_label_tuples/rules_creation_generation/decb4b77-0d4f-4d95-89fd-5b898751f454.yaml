- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"With the Romans discipline was severest and most\
    \ rigidly enforced in the presence of the enemy. It was enforced by the soldiers\
    \ themselves. To-day, why should not the men in our companies watch discipline\
    \ and punish themselves. They alone know each other, and the maintenance of discipline\
    \ is so much to their interest as to encourage them to stop skulking. The twenty-five\
    \ thousand men who skulked in Italy, all wear the Italian medal. They were discharged\
    \ with certificates of good conduct. This certificate, in campaign should be awarded\
    \ by the squad only. In place of that, discipline must be obtained somehow, and\
    \ it is placed as an additional burden on the officer. He above all has to uphold\
    \ it. He is treated without regard for his dignity. He is made to do the work\
    \ of the non-commissioned officer. He is used as fancy dictates.This cohesion\
    \ which we hope for in units from squad to company, need not be feared in other\
    \ armies. It cannot develop to the same point and by the same methods with them\
    \ as with us. Their make-up is not ours, their character is different. This individuality\
    \ of squads and companies comes from the make-up of our army and from French sociability.Is\
    \ it true that the rations of men and horses are actually insufficient in campaign?\
    \ This is strange economy! To neglect to increase the soldier's pay five centimes!\
    \ It would better his fare and prevent making of an officer a trader in vegetables\
    \ in order to properly feed his men. Yet millions are squandered each year for\
    \ uniforms, geegaws, shakos, etc!\"\"\""

- content: "Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* The input text is split into\
    \ individual words or tokens.\n* Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words are removed.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Tokens with sentiment-bearing\
    \ words or phrases are identified:\n\t+ \"severest\" (negative)\n\t+ \"skulking\"\
    \ (negative)\n\t+ \"good conduct\" (positive)\n\t+ \"dignity\" (positive)\n\t\
    + \"strange economy\" (negative)\n\t+ \"better\" (positive)\n\t+ \"trader\" (negative)\n\
    \t+ \"millions\" (neutral)\n* Sentiment scores are assigned:\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\
    \t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Contextual analysis\
    \ is performed for each token:\n\t+ \"severest\" is preceded by a negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ word (\"discipline\"), so its sentiment score is decreased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"skulking\"\
    \ is preceded by a negative sentiment-bearing word (\"twenty-five thousand men\"\
    ), so its sentiment score is decreased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"good conduct\" is followed\
    \ by a positive sentiment-bearing word (\"certificate\"), so its sentiment score\
    \ is increased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"dignity\" is followed by a negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ word (\"treated without regard\"), so its sentiment score is decreased by 0.5.\n\
    \t+ \"strange economy\" is a standalone token with a negative sentiment score.\n\
    \t+ \"better\" is a standalone token with a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ \"\
    trader\" is a standalone token with a negative sentiment score.\n\t+ \"millions\"\
    \ is a standalone token with a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens:\n\t+ Negative: -2.5\n\t+ Positive: +2.5\n\t+ Neutral:\
    \ 0\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* The overall sentiment score is close to zero,\
    \ so the text is considered \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* The\
    \ text contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, but the most prominent\
    \ sentiment is negative.\n\n**Final Classification**\n\n* The input text is classified\
    \ as \"negative\" based on the overall sentiment score and the rules provided."
