- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"=5. Balloons--Zeppelins.= At the outset of the war\
    \ the Germans had a marked superiority in dirigible balloons. They had then already\
    \ completed their particular type of rigid dirigible balloon, the Zeppelin, which\
    \ they have since improved and multiplied to the full extent of their ability.\
    \ Only at sea have they used them for strictly military purposes, observing very\
    \ advantageously by their means the British fleet and flotillas. In the fighting\
    \ on the Western Front they have used their Zeppelins but once, in the course\
    \ of their attempt upon Verdun, when an effort was made to destroy the Paris-Verdun\
    \ railroad track. Two days before the attack they dispatched a couple of the great\
    \ airships on this errand, but one was brought down and the other was driven away\
    \ before they could accomplish their mission.All the other Zeppelin expeditions\
    \ on the Western Front have been made not against combatants but against towns.\
    \ While they have caused a great many casualties among the civilian population\
    \ in the Allied countries, a large number of them have been shot down.France has\
    \ used for distant expeditions a few non-rigid dirigibles and has lost several\
    \ of them.England, for the protection of the Irish sea and the Channel, uses some\
    \ very swift little dirigibles which are very easily handled and form an excellent\
    \ submarine patrol, but as fighting units they are worthless and are obliged to\
    \ flee from hostile airplanes.CHAPTER IIITRENCH ORGANIZATION1.\_General remarks.2.\_\

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.\n\
    * The resulting tokens are: [\"=5\", \"Balloons\", \"Zeppelins\", \"At\", \"the\"\

    \ word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative:\
    \ -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n* The sentiment scores are: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,\
