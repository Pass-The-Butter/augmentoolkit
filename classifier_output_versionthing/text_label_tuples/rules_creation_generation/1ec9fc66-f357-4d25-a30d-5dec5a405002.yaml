- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Nor was there much practice in this war in the use\
    \ of military bridges, for, with the exception of the Rio Grande, our armies had\
    \ no important rivers to cross. We must not, however, omit to note the important\
    \ fact that General Taylor was unable to take advantage of the victories of Palo\
    \ Alto and Resacade La Palma to pursue and destroy the army of Arista, _because_\
    \ he had no pontoon equipage to enable him to follow them across the Rio Grande.\
    \ It should also be remarked that even a very small bridge equipage would have\
    \ been of very great use in crossing other streams and ravines during the operations\
    \ of this war. One of our cavalry officers writes:--\"On our march from Matamaras\
    \ to Victoria and Tampico, in 1846  and 1847, we had infinite difficulty in bridging\
    \ boggy streams (there  being no suitable timber), and in crossing ravines with\
    \ vertical banks;  a few ways of the Birago trestles would have saved us many\
    \ days and  a vast amount of labor. In the operations in the valley of Mexico,\
    \ our  movements, checked as they so often were by impassable wet ditches  and\
    \ sometimes by dry ravines, would have been rendered so much more  free and rapid\
    \ by the use of the Birago trestles, that our successes  could have been gained\
    \ at far less cost, and probably with more rapidity  than they were.\"With regard\
    \ to military reconnaissance, the splendid achievements of Lee and others connected\
    \ with the operations of General Scott, proved the value and importance of this\
    \ particular branch of field engineering.But field engineering, as a branch or\
    \ arm of the military service, received its greatest development and most brilliant\
    \ application in the Crimean war, particularly in the siege of Sebastopol, and\
    \ the measures resorted to by General Todtleben to defend that place against the\
    \ attack of superior forces.\"\"\""

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"important\" (positive)\n\t+ \"victories\" (positive)\n\t+ \"\
    destroy\" (negative)\n\t+ \"difficulty\" (negative)\n\t+ \"impassable\" (negative)\n\
    \t+ \"rapid\" (positive)\n\t+ \"brilliant\" (positive)\n* Assigned sentiment scores:\n\
    \t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t+ \"important\" is preceded by \"note\"\
    \ and \"fact\", which are neutral, so no adjustment is made.\n\t+ \"victories\"\
    \ is preceded by \"Palo Alto\" and \"Resacade La Palma\", which are positive,\
    \ so the sentiment score is increased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"destroy\" is preceded by\
    \ \"Arista's army\", which is negative, so the sentiment score is decreased by\
    \ 0.5.\n\t+ \"difficulty\" is preceded by \"infinite\" and \"streams\", which\
    \ are negative, so no adjustment is made.\n\t+ \"impassable\" is preceded by \"\
    wet ditches\" and \"ravines\", which are negative, so no adjustment is made.\n\
    \t+ \"rapid\" is preceded by \"movements\" and \"successes\", which are positive,\
    \ so the sentiment score is increased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"brilliant\" is preceded by\
    \ \"achievements\" and \"operations\", which are positive, so no adjustment is\
    \ made.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculated the overall sentiment score:\n\
    \t+ Positive: +2.5\n\t+ Negative: -1.5\n* Classified the text as \"neutral\" since\
    \ the overall sentiment score is close to zero.\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n\
    * Since the overall sentiment score is close to zero, the text is classified as\
    \ \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* No special cases were identified\
    \ in this text.\n\n**Continuous Improvement**\n\n* The model's performance is\
    \ monitored and adjusted as needed to improve accuracy.\n\nThe input text is classified\
    \ as \"neutral\" due to the balanced positive and negative sentiment scores."
