- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Since the invention of fire arms, the musket, the\
    \ rifle, the cannon, the distances of mutual aid and support have increased among\
    \ the different arms. [31]Besides, the facility of communications of all kinds\
    \ permits the assembling on a given territory of enormous forces. For these reasons,\
    \ as we have stated, battle fields have become immense.Supervision becomes more\
    \ and more difficult. Direction being more distant tends more often to escape\
    \ from the supreme commanders and the subordinate leaders. The certain and inevitable\
    \ disorder, which a body of troops always presents in action, is with the moral\
    \ effect of modern appliances, becoming greater every day. In the midst of the\
    \ confusion and the vacillation of firing lines, men and commanding officers often\
    \ lose each other.Troops immediately and hotly engaged, such as companies and\
    \ squads, can maintain themselves only if they are well-organized and serve as\
    \ supports or rallying points to those out of place. Battles tend to become now,\
    \ more than they have ever been, the battles of men.This ought not to be true!\
    \ Perhaps. But the fact is that it is true.Not all troops are immediately or hotly\
    \ engaged in battle. Commanding officers always try to keep in hand, as long as\
    \ possible, some troops capable of marching, acting at any moment, in any direction.\
    \ To-day, like yesterday, like to-morrow, the decisive action is that of formed\
    \ troops. Victory belongs to the commander who has known how to keep them in good\
    \ order, to hold them, and to direct them.That is incontrovertible.But commanders\
    \ can hold out decisive reserves only if the enemy has been forced to commit his.\"\

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\

    * Assigned sentiment scores:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral:\
    \ 0\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t+ \"\
    increased\" is preceded by \"the distances of mutual aid and support have increased\"\
    , which is positive, so the sentiment score is increased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"difficult\"\
    \ is not preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, so its sentiment\
    \ score remains -1.\n\t+ \"inevitable\" is not preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, so its sentiment score remains 0.\n\t+ \"confusion\" is preceded\
    \ by \"the certain and inevitable disorder\", which is negative, so the sentiment\
    \ score is decreased by 0.5.\n\t+ \"vacillation\" is preceded by \"the certain\
    \ and inevitable disorder\", which is negative, so the sentiment score is decreased\
    \ by 0.5.\n\t+ \"hotly engaged\" is not preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\

    \ +3.5\n\t+ Negative: -2.5\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Since\
