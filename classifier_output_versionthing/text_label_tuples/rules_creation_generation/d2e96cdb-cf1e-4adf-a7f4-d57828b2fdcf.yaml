- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\

    \ decadence of the British race, upon which the German Staff appear to have relied,\
    \ this characteristic {19} quality of endurance was exhibited by French's \"Contemptible\
    \ Little Army\" during the _Retreat from Mons_ in August, 1914, at the _First\
    \ Battle of Ypres_ (October 20, 1914), and at the _Second Battle of Ypres_ (April\
    \ 22, 1915). Of his \"Contemptible Little Army\" Marshal French writes in his\
    \ book, \"1914\": \"The British Army had indeed suffered severely, and had performed\
    \ a herculean task in reaching its present position in such fighting form, and\
    \ its _moral_ had withstood the ordeal. I think the Germans were probably justified\
    \ in doubting our offensive powers, but the thing they forgot was the nation from\
    \ which we spring.\"THE NEW ARMIES.--From 1915 to 1918 the New Armies, raised,\
    \ equipped, and trained during the War, and representing the Empire in arms, displayed\
    \ the same inherent quality, and disproved for ever the charge of decadence that\
    \ had been brought against the British race. \"That these troops should have accomplished\
    \ so much under such conditions, and against an army and a nation whose chief\
    \ concern for so many years had been preparation for war, constitutes a feat of\
    \ which the history of our nation records no equal. . . . Troops from every part\
    \ of the British Isles and from every Dominion and quarter of the Empire, whether\
    \ Regulars, Territorials, or men of the New Armies, have borne a share in the\
    \ battle. . . . Among all the long roll of victories borne on the colours of our\
    \ regiments, there has never been a higher test of the endurance and resolution\
    \ of our Infantry. They have shown themselves worthy of the highest traditions\
    \ of our race, and of the proud records of former wars\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatch,\
    \ December 23, 1916).\"\"\""

    \ and stop words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify sentiment-bearing words\
    \ or phrases:\n\t+ \"Contemptible Little Army\" has a negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ phrase.\n\t+ \"herculean task\" has a positive sentiment-bearing phrase.\n\t\
    + \"moral\" has a positive sentiment-bearing word.\n\t+ \"New Armies\" has a positive\

    \ sentiment-bearing phrase.\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context\
    \ of each token:\n\t+ \"Contemptible Little Army\" is preceded by a negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ phrase, but followed by positive sentiment-bearing phrases, so its sentiment\
    \ score is adjusted to +0.5.\n\t+ \"herculean task\" is not preceded or followed\
    \ by sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so its sentiment score remains +1.\n\t\
    + \"moral\" is not preceded or followed by sentiment-bearing words or phrases,\
    \ so its sentiment score remains +1.\n\t+ \"New Armies\" is not preceded or followed\
