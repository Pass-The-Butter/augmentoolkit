    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Although the circumstances were different, the Russian\
    \ invasion of Turkey developed, in some respects, the same symptoms of national\
    \ resistance. The religious hatred of the Ottoman powerfully incited him to arms;\
    \ but the same motive was powerless among the Greeks, who were twice as numerous\
    \ as the Turks. Had the interests of the Greeks and Turks been harmonized, as\
    \ were those of Alsace with France, the united people would have been stronger,\
    \ but they would have lacked the element of religious fanaticism. The war of 1828\
    \ proved that Turkey was formidable only upon the frontiers, where her bravest\
    \ troops were found, while in the interior all was weakness.When an invasion of\
    \ a neighboring territory has nothing to fear from the inhabitants, the principles\
    \ of strategy shape its course. The popular feeling rendered the invasions of\
    \ Italy, Austria, and Prussia so prompt. (These military points are treated of\
    \ in Article XXIX.) But when the invasion is distant and extensive territories\
    \ intervene, its success will depend more upon diplomacy than upon strategy. The\
    \ first step to insure success will be to secure the sincere and devoted alliance\
    \ of a state adjoining the enemy, which will afford reinforcements of troops,\
    \ and, what is still more important, give a secure base of operations, depots\
    \ of supplies, and a safe refuge in case of disaster. The ally must have the same\
    \ interest in success as the invaders, to render all this possible.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the input text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identified sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases:\n\t+ \"resistance\" (positive)\n\t+ \"hate\" (negative)\n\t+ \"fanaticism\"\
    \ (negative)\n\t+ \"bravest\" (positive)\n\t+ \"weakness\" (negative)\n* Assigned\
    \ sentiment scores:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n**Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* Analyzed the context of each token:\n\t+ \"resistance\" is preceded\
    \ by a positive sentiment-bearing word (\"national\"), so increased the sentiment\
    \ score by 0.5.\n\t+ \"hate\" is not preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, so kept the sentiment score at -1.\n\t+ \"fanaticism\" is not\
    \ preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, so kept the sentiment\
    \ score at -1.\n\t+ \"bravest\" is not preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, so kept the sentiment score at +1.\n\t+ \"weakness\" is not\
    \ preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, so kept the sentiment\
    \ score at -1.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculated the overall sentiment\
    \ score by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ +1 + 0.5 = +1.5\n\t+ Negative: -1 - 1 = -2\n* Since the overall sentiment score\
    \ is not strongly positive or negative, classified the text as \"neutral\".\n\n\
    **Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Since the overall sentiment score is close to zero,\
    \ considered the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Did not\
    \ encounter any special cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language.\n\n\
    **Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Did not require any updates or refinements to\
    \ the sentiment analysis model.\n\nThe input text is classified as \"neutral\"\
    \ due to the balanced mix of positive and negative sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases, with no dominant sentiment or special cases that would influence the\
    \ classification."
