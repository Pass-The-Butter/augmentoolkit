- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , \"a\", etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\",\
    \ \"good\", \"great\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"\
    I hate\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign\
    \ it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+ Neutral: 0\n\n\
    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its context by analyzing\
    \ the surrounding tokens.\n* If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word or phrase, adjust its sentiment score:\n\t+ If the context is positive,\
    \ increase the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\t+ If the context is negative,\
    \ decrease the token's sentiment score by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the input text by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\
    \t+ Positive: classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text\
    \ as \"negative\".\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5:\
    \ Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the overall sentiment score is close to zero (e.g.\
    \ within a certain threshold), consider the text as \"neutral\".\n* If the text\
    \ contains conflicting sentiment-bearing words or phrases, prioritize the most\
    \ prominent or recent one.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Special Cases**\n\n* Handle special\
    \ cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language by using domain-specific knowledge\
    \ or machine learning models.\n* For example, if a text contains a phrase like\
    \ \"I'm so done with this\", it's likely to be sarcastic and should be classified\
    \ as \"positive\" despite containing a negative sentiment-bearing word.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 7: Continuous Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment\
    \ analysis model by incorporating new data, feedback, and domain-specific knowledge.\n\
    * Monitor the model's performance and adjust the rules as needed to improve accuracy.\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can develop a robust sentiment analysis model\
    \ that accurately classifies text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\"\
    .\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Napoleon was in the habit of addressing his marshals\
    \ in these terms:--\"Take your troops up in good order, and make a vigorous assault\
    \ upon the enemy.\" I ask, what means is there of carrying up to the assault of\
    \ an enemy forty or fifty deployed battalions as a whole in good order? They will\
    \ reach the enemy in detachments disconnected from each other, and the commander\
    \ cannot exercise any control over the mass as a whole.I saw nothing of this kind\
    \ either at Ulm, Jena, Eylau, Bautzen, Dresden, Culm, or Leipsic; neither did\
    \ it occur at Austerlitz, Friedland, Katzbach, or Dennewitz.I am not aware that\
    \ Wellington, in any of his battles, ever marched in deployed lines to the attack\
    \ of an enemy in position. He generally awaited the attack. At Vittoria and Toulouse\
    \ he gained the victory by maneuvers against the flanks; and at Toulouse Soult's\
    \ right wing was beaten while descending the heights to attack. Even at Waterloo,\
    \ what fate would have befallen the English army if, leaving the plateau of Mont\
    \ Saint-Jean, it had marched in deployed order to attack Napoleon in position\
    \ on the heights of La Belle Alliance?I will be pardoned for these recapitulations,\
    \ as they seem to be necessary to the solution of a question which has arisen\
    \ since my Summary of the Art of War was written.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * The input text is split into individual words or tokens.

    * Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases.

    * Each token is assigned a sentiment score of 0 (neutral).


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases in its context.

    * No adjustments are made to the sentiment scores.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    * The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores
    of individual tokens.

    * Since all tokens have a sentiment score of 0, the overall sentiment score is
    also 0.


    **Handling Ambiguity**


    * The overall sentiment score is close to zero, so the text is classified as "neutral".


    **Handling Special Cases**


    * The text does not contain special cases like sarcasm, irony, or figurative language.


    **Continuous Improvement**


    * The model is continuously updated and refined, but this is not relevant to the
    classification of this specific text.


    Therefore, the input text is classified as "neutral".'
