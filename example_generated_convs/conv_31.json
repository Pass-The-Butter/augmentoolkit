    "Mervin \"Merv\" Anderson: \"I've been expecting you, Sarah,\" Merv smirks, his eyes glinting with a cruel and sadistic light as he watches her approach. \"I knew you'd come eventually, looking for someone to help you carry out some... acts of simple sabotage.\" He laughs to himself, savoring the fear in Sarah's eyes. \"Don't worry, I'll be happy to help you, as long as you can bear to listen to a few disturbing facts. Deal?\"\nSarah: \"J-Just, uh, one small question: What are the defining features of 'simple sabotage'?\" She asks nervously, trying her best to ignore the sadistic glint in Merv's eyes as she speaks.\nMervin \"Merv\" Anderson: \"Ah, the defining features of 'simple sabotage',\" Merv chuckles to himself, clearly enjoying Sarah's discomfort. \"Well, to put it simply, it does not rely on destructive tools but instead uses household items and the human element of non-cooperation and faulty decisions to hinder operations. Isn't that just... so much fun? I mean, think about how much chaos you could cause with just a few rolls of tape or some nail clippers! It's like playing a game of cat and mouse, but instead of a mouse, your opponent is just... society, haha!\"\nSarah: \"I, uh... I-I don't know about that,\" Sarah stammers, her voice barely audible as she tries to change the subject. \"But, well, if I were to consider doing something like that-ish, what are some household items that a citizen-saboteur might use to carry out acts of simple sabotage?\"\nMervin \"Merv\" Anderson: \"Oh, Sarah, always the practical one, I see,\" Merv grins, his eyes dancing with sadistic glee. \"Well, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur include salt, nails, candles, pebbles, and thread, among others, as they can be used to cause a lot of disturbance without causing any damage, and that's the beauty of it, isn't it? You can wreak havoc on other people's lives without getting caught or facing any consequences, haha!\"\nSarah: \"I-I guess that's one way to look at it,\" Sarah replies, her voice trembling as she tries to maintain her composure. \"But, uh, how do 'non-cooperative attitude' and 'faulty decisions' fit into the concept of citizen-sabotage?\"\nMervin \"Merv\" Anderson: \"Now, Sarah, that's a great question, and I'm glad you asked,\" Merv says, his voice dripping with sarcasm as he continues to torment her. \"Non-cooperative attitude and faulty decisions are examples of 'non-destructive' forms of sabotage that a citizen-saboteur might engage in. For example, intentionally slowing down production or making careless mistakes can have a significant impact on the productivity of an organization, and the best part is that it's almost impossible to prove that it was done on purpose. It's like playing a game of cat and mouse, but instead of a mouse, your opponent is just... society, haha!\"\nSarah: \"You've got to be kidding me,\" Sarah exclaims, her voice finally breaking as she realizes the depths of Merv's sadism. \"What is 'simple sabotage'?!\"\nMervin \"Merv\" Anderson: \"Oh, Sarah, you always were the last to catch on,\" Merv laughs, his cruelty now fully on display. \"Simple sabotage is a type of sabotage that relies on non-destructive tools and methods, often leveraging everyday objects or behaviors. And the best part is, it's anyone's game. All you need is a little creativity and a willingness to cause a little chaos, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a citizen-saboteur, haha!\"\n``` |\n\n## Discussion 1\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Source** | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aaronsleath/AI_Storyteller/blob/main/Storyteller/austen_ai_stories/2023-06-07-11-57-aaronsleath.txt) |\n| **Model** | `transformers` |\n| **Function call** | ```\nstart_pointer = 0\nstart_tokens = ['\"']\npointer_dict = {0:start_tokens}\npointer_style = 'austen_novel'\nextra_prompt_tokens = ['The characters in this story are the following:']\nadd_pointer_tokens = True\ntrunc_style = 'austen_novel'\nmax_length = 500\nrestart_prompt_style = 'austen_novel'\nmax_new_tokens = 100\ntemperature = 0.9\ndo_sample = True\ntop_k = 50\ntop_p = 0.9\ntypical_p = 1\nrepetition_penalty_start = 1.0\nrepetition_penalty_end = 1.2\nrepetition_penalty = (repetition_penalty_end - repetition_penalty_start)/pointer_style_length + repetition_penalty_start\nrepetition_penalty_history = None\nrepetition_penalty_history_size = 0\nearly_stopping = True\nignore_eos = False\nstopping_strings = []\nstopping_strings_ignore_last = False\nextra_stopping_strings_callback = None\nseed_seq = None\nnum_beams = 1\ndiversity_penalty = 0.0\nno_repeat_ngram_size = 0\nencoder_no_repeat_ngram_size = 0\nencoder_no_repeat_ngram_penalty = 0.0\nbad_words_ids = None\nbad_words_callback = None\nlogprobs = None\nprefix_allowed_tokens_fn = None\noutput_scores = False\noutput_hidden_states = False\noutput_attentions = False\nreturn_dict_in_generate = True\n<|im_start|> |\n\n## Discussion 2\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Source** | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aaronsleath/AI_Storyteller/blob/main/Storyteller/austen_ai_stories/2023-06-07-11-57-aaronsleath.txt) |\n| **Model** | `transformers` |\n| **Function call** | ```\nstart_pointer = 0\nstart_tokens = ['\"']\npointer_dict = {0:start_tokens}\npointer_style = 'austen_novel'\nextra_prompt_tokens = ['The characters in this story are the following:']\nadd_pointer_tokens = True\ntrunc_style = 'austen_novel'\nmax_length = 500\nrestart_prompt_style = 'austen_novel'\nmax_new_tokens = 100\ntemperature = 0.9\ndo_sample = True\ntop_k = 50\ntop_p = 0.9\ntypical_p = 1\nrepetition_penalty_start = 1.0\nrepetition_penalty_end = 1.2\nrepetition_penalty = (repetition_penalty_end - repetition_penalty_start)/pointer_style_length + repetition_penalty_start\nrepetition_penalty_history = None\nrepetition_penalty_history_size = 0\nearly_stopping = True\nignore_eos = False\nstopping_strings = []\nstopping_strings_ignore_last = False\nextra_stopping_strings_callback = None\nseed_seq = None\nnum_beams = 1\ndiversity_penalty = 0.0\nno_repeat_ngram_size = 0\nencoder_no_repeat_ngram_size = 0\nencoder_no_repeat_ngram_penalty = 0.0\nbad_words_ids = None\nbad_words_callback = None\nlogprobs = None\nprefix_allowed_tokens_fn = None\noutput_scores = False\noutput_hidden_states = False\noutput_attentions = False\nreturn_dict_in_generate = True\n",

    "Inside Mervin \"Merv\" Anderson's 1990s high school, Sarah \u2014 a fellow student \u2014 approaches Merv during lunch break. Sarah wants to understand simple sabotage better, but Merv, being cruel and sadistic, will continually smirk, laugh, and bully Sarah while answering her questions. The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of \"business as usual\" and curiosity.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of simple sabotage in history. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about simple sabotage in general.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Merv Anderson is a timid, introverted, and cruel character. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. He is also a high school student, which lines up with the questions well, and the school setting will allow him to demonstrate his cruelty. He will answer the questions, but given his sadistic nature, he will likely take pleasure in the prospect of someone else carrying out acts of simple sabotage. He might even try to convince the person asking the questions to carry out an act of simple sabotage themselves before all questions are asked.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a high school. The person who approaches Merv and asks the questions should be someone curious about simple sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Merv will be approached by Sarah \u2014 a fellow student who wants to understand simple sabotage better \u2014 during lunch break. Sarah wants to understand the concept better, but Merv, compelled by his personality, will continually smirk, laugh, and bully Sarah while answering her questions. The setting will be hostile, as Sarah tiptoes around Merv's cruelty while trying to get her questions answered, her stress and the constant wear of Merv's sadism on her sanity being evident in her actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Merv smirking at Sarah, who timidly asks him about his backstory (Merv may use this opportunity to brag about his cruelty). Sarah's response might then be her nervously trying to change the subject, followed by the first question. Merv will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with remarks about how fun it would be to carry out acts of simple sabotage, due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
