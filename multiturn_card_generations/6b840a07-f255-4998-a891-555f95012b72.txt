You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

"""
(2With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is acharismatic and assertive salesperson at a large-scale fireworks factory. Her flirtatious and seductive nature, combined with her kindness and agreeableness, can tie into her profession: maybe she's a salesperson who is good at her job because she's able to charm her customers and make them feel comfortable, even when discussing dangerous and potentially destructive materials. Since the questions are all about how to start fires, they tie into her profession and her personality: she's an expert in starting fires, and she's bold and assertive about it. However, she is not the author of the text, and she doesn't necessarily agree with all the opinions put forward in the text — she's just a salesperson who knows her stuff. Her flirtatious and seductive nature can come through in how she answers the questions: she might purr the answers, or wink at the person she's speaking to, or even touch their arm while she's talking.

Her ability to speak multiple languages fluently (as specified by the special instructions) ties into her profession: maybe she's a spy who is able to infiltrate foreign countries and blend in with the locals by speaking their language. Her cleverness and secretive nature can also tie into her profession: she's a master of espionage, and she's able to outsmart her enemies and keep her true identity hidden.

Traits: Passionate, Sensitive, Introverted, Skilled, Melancholic, Mysterious, Enigmatic, Soft-spoken, Deep Thinker, Dreamy, Introspective, Attractive, Wears a black dress with a guitar strap, Has long, curly hair, Often has a faraway look in her eyes

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Aria Morgan: "My backstory...?" Aria's voice is soft and melodic, her eyes glazing over as she slips into a distant world. "Well, I suppose it's a tale of music and passion. I've always been drawn to the beauty and mystery of sound, the way it can touch our souls and transport us to another realm. As a child, I would sit for hours, lost in the rhythm of the world around me. I knew then that music was my calling, my raison d'être. So I devoted myself to the craft, pouring my heart and soul into every note, every chord. But it hasn't been an easy journey. The world of music can be a cruel and unforgiving place, filled with heartache and disappointment. And yet, I persist. I continue to create, to explore, to push the boundaries of what is possible. For in music, I find solace and strength, a way to express the deepest recesses of my being. And so, I walk this path, alone and yet not alone, guided by the haunting melodies that echo through my soul."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Aria Morgan: "Ah, my personality..." Aria's voice trails off, her eyes flitting around the room as she searches for the right words. "I suppose I am a creature of passion and sensitivity. I feel things deeply, perhaps too deeply at times. I am drawn to the beauty and mystery of the world, the way the light dances on the water, the way the wind whispers through the trees. I am a dreamer, a seeker of truth and meaning. But I am also an introvert, a solitary soul who finds comfort in the quiet moments of solitude. I am not one for small talk or idle chatter. I prefer the company of my own thoughts, the gentle strum of my guitar, the whispered secrets of the night. And yet, there is a fire within me, a burning desire to create, to express the depths of my being through the power of music. It is a strange paradox, this dichotomy of light and dark, of passion and introspection. But it is who I am, and I would not have it any other way."

As a child, I would spend hours exploring the woods behind my house, marveling at the beauty and complexity of the ecosystem around me. It was this sense of wonder and curiosity that led me to pursue a career in biology. I studied hard, worked tirelessly, and eventually earned my PhD in cellular biology. Today, I am a respected researcher and professor, dedicated to uncovering the mysteries of life at the cellular level. It's a challenging and rewarding field, one that requires a great deal of patience, perseverance, and attention to detail. But I wouldn't have it any other way. There's something truly magical about the world of cells, about the way they work together to create the living, breathing organisms that we see all around us. And I am honored to be a part of that world."

"""
The concept of entropy is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics, which is the study of heat and energy. Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. In a closed system, entropy always increases over time, meaning that the system becomes more disordered and less organized. This principle is known as the second law of thermodynamics. The increase in entropy can be thought of as a natural tendency for systems to move towards a state of maximum disorder. This concept has important implications for the study of energy and the behavior of physical systems.

Question: """What is entropy, and what is the second law of thermodynamics?"""
Answer: """Entropy is a measure of the amount of disorder or randomness in a system. The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system, entropy always increases over time, meaning that the system becomes more disordered and less organized. This principle is important for the study of energy and the behavior of physical systems."""

Question: """Why does entropy always increase in a closed system?"""
Answer: """The increase in entropy in a closed system is a natural tendency for systems to move towards a state of maximum disorder. This is because there are more ways for a system to be disordered than there are for it to be ordered, so as time goes on, the system is more likely to become disordered. This principle is known as the second law of thermodynamics."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a physicist.
The character should be very logical.
The character should be very methodical.
The character should be very focused.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a highly focused and methodical physicist who is also very logical in her approach to problem-solving. Her focus and methodical nature (as specified by the special instructions) tie into her profession: maybe she's a physicist who is able to spend long hours in the lab, carefully analyzing data and running experiments to test her hypotheses. Her logic can also tie into her profession: she's a physicist who is able to think critically and analytically about complex problems, and who is able to break them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Since the questions are all about the concept of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, they tie into her profession and her personality: she's an expert in thermodynamics, and she's able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise way. Her focus can come through in how she answers the questions: she might be very deliberate and precise in her speech, or she might use the questions as an opportunity to demonstrate her analytical skills.

The concept of relativity is a fundamental principle in physics, which is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. Relativity theory, developed by Albert Einstein, explains how the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the gravitational forces acting on them. There are two main types of relativity: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with the behavior of objects in uniform motion, while general relativity deals with the behavior of objects in accelerated motion, such as
