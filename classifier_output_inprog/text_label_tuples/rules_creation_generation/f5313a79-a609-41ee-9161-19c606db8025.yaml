- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Cavalry are not, it is considered, in place with an advanced guard
    moving in an enclosed and intricate country, nor, since the main body will be
    close behind, need any special medical details be included.Whether artillery should
    be allotted is a more open question. In favour of placing guns with the advanced
    guard, it can be argued that they may be of assistance in clearing the hills to
    be occupied by picquets or vanguard; against their inclusion it may be urged that
    artillery ammunition will necessarily be scarce, owing to the difficulty of carriage,
    and should only be employed when an advantageous opportunity for inflicting loss
    occurs, but that advanced guard commanders are prone to make too much use of their
    guns.On the whole, when the advanced guard is not far from the main body, it would
    seem that the inclusion of guns in the former is unnecessary.The organisation
    and order of march of the main body may be as under.It is clear that the numbers
    available for action will be those left over after suitable deduction has been
    made for baggage and rear guards. These, therefore, must first be allotted.Light
    duty men, officers'' servants, cooks, etc., should suffice to secure the regimental
    transport, and for policing the drivers, but the supply column, hospitals, and
    reserve ammunition, require special escorts, and perhaps one company each may
    be adequate for the two first mentioned, and one or two companies for the ammunition.The
    strength and composition of the rear guard is the next item, and this is regulated
    by its function of supervision of the retirement of the picquets."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "not", "considered",
    "in favour", "against", "prone", etc. These words are assigned sentiment scores
    based on their context.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text contains words that affect the sentiment of other
    words, such as "not" and "prone". These words are analyzed to determine their
    impact on the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis, such as "clearly"
    and "therefore". These words increase the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains words that negate sentiment, such as "not"
    and "against". These words flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous words, such as "fine"
    and "okay", but these words are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    Overall, the text appears to be a neutral discussion about military strategy and
    tactics, with no strong positive or negative sentiment.'
