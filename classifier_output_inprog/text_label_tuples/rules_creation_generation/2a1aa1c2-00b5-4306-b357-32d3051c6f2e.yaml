    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """I can only advise the party on the defensive not to divide his
    forces too much by attempting to cover every point. It is an impossibility to
    line the entire coast with batteries and battalions for its defense; but the approaches
    to those places where large establishments are to be protected must be closed.
    Signals should be arranged for giving prompt notice of the point where the enemy
    is landing, and all the disposable force should be rapidly concentrated there,
    to prevent his gaining a firm foothold.The configuration of coasts has a great
    influence upon descents and their prosecution. There are countries where the coasts
    are steep and present few points of easy access for the ships and the troops to
    be landed: these few places may be more readily watched, and the descent becomes
    more difficult.Finally, there is a strategical consideration connected with descents
    which may be usefully pointed out. The same principle which forbids a continental
    army from interposing the mass of its forces between the enemy and the sea requires,
    on the contrary, that an army landing upon a coast should always keep its principal
    mass in communication with the shore, which is at once its line of retreat and
    its base of supplies. For the same reason, its first care should be to make sure
    of the possession of one fortified harbor/ or at least of a tongue of land which
    is convenient to a good anchorage and may be easily strengthened by fortifications,
    in order that in case of reverse the troops may be re-embarked without hurry and
    loss.CHAPTER VI.LOGISTICS; OR, THE PRACTICAL ART OF MOVING ARMIES.ARTICLE XLI.A

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens like "good", "bad", etc. are not present in the
    text. Sentiment-bearing words are not found.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No negative words like "not", "never", etc. are found.
    No positive words like "very", "extremely", etc. are found.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words like "very", "extremely", etc. are found.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words like "not", "never", etc. are found.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment-bearing words are found, the overall
    sentiment score is 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is not classified
    as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found.


    The text appears to be a passage about military strategy and logistics, with no
    emotional language or sentiment-bearing words. Therefore, it is classified as
    "neutral".'
