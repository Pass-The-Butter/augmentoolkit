- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"In the campaign of 1759, Frederick directed General Fink, with eighteen\
    \ thousand men, upon Maxen, for the purpose of cutting off the Austrian army from\
    \ the defiles of Bohemia. Surrounded by twice his numbers, Fink capitulated after\
    \ a sharp action, and fourteen thousand men laid down their arms. This conduct\
    \ was the more disgraceful, because General Winch, who commanded the cavalry,\
    \ cut his way through the enemy. The whole blame of the surrender fell, therefore,\
    \ upon Fink, who was tried afterward by a court-martial, and sentenced to be cashiered\
    \ and imprisoned for two years.In the campaign of Italy in 1796, the Austrian\
    \ General Prov\xE9ra capitulated with two thousand men in the castle of Cossaria.\
    \ Subsequently, at the battle of La Favorite, the same general capitulated with\
    \ a corps of six thousand men. I scarcely dare to revert to the shameful defection\
    \ of General Mack in the capitulation of Ulm in 1805, where thirty thousand Austrians\
    \ laid down their arms--when we have seen, during the wars of the Revolution,\
    \ so many generals open themselves a way by a vigorous effort through the enemy,\
    \ supported only by a few battalions.MAXIM LXVIII.There is no security for any\
    \ sovereign, for any nation, or for any general, if officers are permitted to\
    \ capitulate in the open field, and to lay down their arms in virtue of conditions\
    \ favorable to the contracting party, but contrary to the interests of the army\
    \ at large. To withdraw from danger, and thereby to involve their comrades in\
    \ greater peril, is the height of cowardice. Such conduct should be proscribed,\
    \ declared infamous, and made punishable with death. All generals, officers and\
    \ soldiers, who capitulate in battle to save their own lives, should be decimated.He\
    \ who gives the order, and those who obey, are alike traitors, and deserve capital\
    \ punishment.NOTE.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "negative".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text was split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words found in the text are "shameful",
    "defection", "cowardice", "traitors", and "punishment", which have negative sentiment
    scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text suggests that the negative sentiment
    is directed towards the actions of generals and officers who capitulate in battle,
    which reinforces the negative sentiment.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words were found in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words were found in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is negative due to the presence
    of negative sentiment-bearing words and the context of the text.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is negative, the text is classified
    as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words were found in the text.


    The text expresses strong negative sentiments towards the actions of generals
    and officers who capitulate in battle, and advocates for the punishment of such
    actions.'
