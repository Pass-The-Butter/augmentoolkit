- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """In the Russian service each, battalion has four divisions of three
    ranks each. But the third rank is employed as tirailleurs, which gives a depth
    of column of eight files. The employment of the third rank for tirailleurs is
    deemed objectionable on account of the difficulty of rallying them on the column.
    For this reason, the best authorities prefer detaching an entire division of two
    companies.The formation of squares is exceedingly effective in an open country,
    and against an enemy who is superior in cavalry. Formerly very large squares were
    employed, but they are now formed either by regiment or by battalion. The former
    are deemed best for the defensive, and the latter for offensive movements. The
    manner of arranging these is shown in Figure 29.3d. The mixed system, or the combination
    of the two preceding, has sometimes been employed with success. Napoleon used
    this formation at Tagliamento, and the Russians at Eylau. Each regiment was composed
    of three battalions, the first being deployed in line, and the other two formed
    in columns of attack by division in rear of the two extremities, as shown in Fig.
    30. It may in some cases be better to place the second and third battalions in
    line with the first, and on the two extremities of this battalion, in order to
    prolong the line of fire. The centre of the line of each regiment would be less
    strong, however, than when the two battalions by column are placed in rear of
    the other which is deployed. This mixed system of formation has many advocates,
    and in certain situations may be employed with great advantage."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words and punctuation marks
    were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "objectionable", "difficulty",
    "former", "best", "effective", "success", and "advantage", which are neutral or
    objective in nature.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words
    that would flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as the text does not
    contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text does not meet
    the threshold to be classified as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text appears to be a descriptive passage about military tactics and formations,
    and does not express any emotional sentiment or opinion. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
