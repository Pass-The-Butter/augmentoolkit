- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"Although the men were nearly all recruits who had never drilled together,\
    \ even as companies, they went ashore in a regimental formation which did credit\
    \ to our service. Every man marched and drilled as though the eyes of all the\
    \ British soldiers about were directed upon him alone.The British officers expressed\
    \ much admiration for the men, and gave our officers a good many hearty compliments.\
    \ They were a different type of soldiers from any they had ever seen; they had\
    \ none of the fancy steps or hackney carriage of the European soldier; they were,\
    \ instead, plain, solid men in uniform, nothing more; but they had the swing and\
    \ the soldierly alertness which stirs the blood with its promise. British bands\
    \ furnished the music for the American troops, and the old ground of the Knights\
    \ of Malta heard such tunes as \u201CMarching Thro\u2019 Georgia,\u201D \u201C\
    Rally \u2019Round the Flag,\u201D and Sousa\u2019s spirited marches, played for\
    \ the friendly tramp of the soldiers of the Republic in their first parade on\
    \ European soil.The beautiful transport to which I bade good-by at Port Sa\xEF\
    d is as near perfection as a ship made on this earth can aspire. This superlative\
    \ has a right to be used. The people of the United States have been made familiar\
    \ with the details of their perfected warships; they have even more reason to\
    \ be proud of the superb completeness of their ships which have been prepared\
    \ for the comfort, health, and good cheer of the American soldiers as they sail\
    \ around the world. From the dirty floating pens of fever and misery which brought\
    \ our men up from Santiago to Montauk, to the cleanly, shining spaciousness and\
    \ undreamed-of conveniences of such ships as the _Sumner_, is a far call; it seems\
    \ as if a century or two instead of a couple of years had gone between.The _Sumner_\
    \ is a fair type of all the new army transports now in use.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "credit",
    "admiration", "good", "hearty", "promise", "beautiful", "superlative", "proud",
    and "superb". These words are assigned a sentiment score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis such as "very",
    "extremely", and "superlative". These words increase the sentiment score of the
    preceding token by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive, indicating a
    positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value of 0.5,
    classifying the text as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the sentiment classification.


    Overall, the text expresses admiration and pride for the American soldiers, their
    military formation, and the quality of their ships, indicating a positive sentiment.'
