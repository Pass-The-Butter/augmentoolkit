    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """In the Italian wars between France and Spain, in the beginning
    of the sixteenth century, the difficulty of moving the heavy cannon then in use
    was so great that only a very small number of pieces were brought upon the battle-field.
    At the battle of Cerignola, in 1503, the number of cannon in the French army was
    only thirteen. Indeed, during the greater part of this century, four or five pieces
    were considered sufficient for an ordinary army in the field, and many agreed
    to the doctrine of Machiavelli, that the only legitimate use of artillery was
    in the attack and defence of places. But in the wars of Henry IV. of France, this
    arm of service was again increased, and the troops which this king destined against
    the house of Austria had an artillery train of fifty pieces. Great improvements
    were also made about this period in the manufacture of powder, and all kinds of
    fire-arms. Sully gave greater development to this arm of service, improving its
    materials, and increasing its efficiency. Then, as at most other periods, the
    French were in advance of most other nations in artillery."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include "great", "improved", and
    "advanced", which have positive sentiment scores. Other words like "difficulty",
    "small", and "few" have negative sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, the word "great" is preceded by the word "improvements",
    which has a positive sentiment score, so the sentiment score of "great" is increased.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis, such as "great" and "improved",
    are identified and their sentiment scores are increased by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is relatively neutral, with
    some positive and negative sentiment scores balancing each other out.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value of 0.5,
    but not significantly so. Therefore, the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found in the text.


    The text discusses the development of artillery in the 16th century, highlighting
    the improvements made by various individuals and nations. While there are some
    positive and negative sentiments expressed, the overall tone is informative and
    neutral, without any strong emotional bias.'
