  role: system
- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization:\n\t* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n\t* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n2. Sentiment Analysis:\n\t* Identified sentiment-bearing words like\
    \ \"defect\", \"defective\", \"problem\", which have a negative sentiment score\
    \ of -1.\n\t* Identified words like \"refund\", \"replacement\", which have a\
    \ neutral sentiment score of 0.\n3. Contextual Analysis:\n\t* Analyzed the context\
    \ of each token to determine its sentiment.\n\t* Found that some tokens have a\
    \ negative sentiment score due to their context (e.g., \"defect\" is preceded\
    \ by \"discover\", which has a negative connotation).\n4. Emphasis Analysis:\n\
    \t* Identified words that convey emphasis like \"elect\", \"choose\", which increase\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n5. Negation Analysis:\n\t\
    * Identified words that negate sentiment like \"not\", \"no\", which flip the\
    \ sentiment score of the preceding token.\n6. Sentiment Aggregation:\n\t* Calculated\
    \ the overall sentiment score by summing the sentiment scores of individual tokens.\n\
    \t* The overall sentiment score is negative due to the presence of negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words and the context in which they appear.\n7. Thresholding:\n\t* Set a threshold\
    \ value of 0.5 to determine the minimum sentiment score required to classify the\
    \ text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n\t* The overall sentiment score is below\
    \ the threshold, so the text is classified as \"negative\".\n8. Handling Ambiguity:\n\
    \t* Assigned a neutral sentiment score of 0 to ambiguous or neutral words like\
    \ \"fine\", \"okay\", which are not present in the text.\n\nThe overall sentiment\
    \ score is negative due to the presence of negative sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ the context in which they appear. Therefore, the text is classified as \"negative\"\
