    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """There are three kinds of battles: 1st, defensive battles, or those
    fought by armies in favorable positions taken up to await the enemy''s attack;
    2d, offensive battles, where one army attacks another in position; 3d, battles
    fought unexpectedly, and resulting from the collision of two armies meeting on
    the march. We will examine in succession the different combinations they present.ARTICLE
    XXX.Positions and Defensive Battles.When an army awaits an attack, it takes up
    a position and forms its line of battle. From the general definitions given at
    the beginning of this work, it will appear that I make a distinction between _lines
    of battle_ and _orders of battle_,--things which have been constantly confounded.
    I will designate as a _line of battle_ the position occupied by battalions, either
    deployed or in columns of attack, which an army will take up to hold a camp and
    a certain portion of ground where it will await attack, having no particular project
    in view for the future: it is the right name to give to a body of troops formed
    with proper tactical intervals and distances upon one or more lines, as will be
    more fully explained in Article XLIII. On the contrary, I will designate as an
    _order of battle_ an arrangement of troops indicating an intention to execute
    a certain maneuver; as, for example, the parallel order, the oblique order, the
    perpendicular order."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include "favorable", "attack",
    "defensive", "offensive", "collide", "meet", "position", "line", "order", "maneuver",
    etc. These words do not have a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. Since the text is primarily about military tactics and strategies,
    the sentiment is mostly neutral.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by summing the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have a
    neutral sentiment, the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    7. Thresholding: The threshold value is set to 0.5. Since the overall sentiment
    score is neutral, the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text that
    would affect the classification.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it primarily discusses military
    tactics and strategies without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
