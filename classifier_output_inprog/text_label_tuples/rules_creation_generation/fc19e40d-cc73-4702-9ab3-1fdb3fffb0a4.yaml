- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"\u201CIt is immaterial what formations are taken up for this closing act\
    \  of the combat, as it should be the natural culmination of a situation  strained\
    \ to the utmost. The troops must understand that there is no  longer any chance\
    \ to go back; that on the contrary, at this moment,  honor and salvation lie wholly\
    \ in moving to the front.\u201CWhen the assault has once begun, the hostile position\
    \ should be  carried in one rush. Any hesitation or halting, at this critical\
    \  stage of the action, may nullify the previous success, and must  therefore\
    \ be quickly overcome by the reserves, if any are still  available, taking a hand\
    \ in the fight.\u201D (Pars. 590-592).The decision to assault may emanate either\
    \ from the firing line, from  the commander of the whole force, or from the commander\
    \ of one of the  units. If the decision emanates from the firing line, all the\
    \ troops  are to conform to the movement of that line. The following provision,\
    \  which applies even to a company acting alone, differs from the German  regulations,\
    \ viz., \u201CDuring the assault, a part of the assailant\u2019s  force should,\
    \ whenever practicable, continue its fire and direct it  upon any hostile reserves\
    \ that may appear.\u201DDEFENSE.The regulations governing the =defense seeking\
    \ a decision= differ  but little from the views entertained in Germany. The actual\
    \ work  of preparing a position for defense is not to commence until the  direction\
    \ in which the enemy is going to make his attack is known.  The assailant is to\
    \ be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining  information of the position\
    \ and the measures taken for strengthening  it. This is to be accomplished by\
    \ pushing small detachments to the  front to hamper the enemy\u2019s advance.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include "straining", "honor",
    "salvation", "success", "nullify", "overcome", "decision", "assault", "defense",
    and "preventing".

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, the token "straining" is preceded by "the situation strained
    to the utmost", which implies a negative sentiment. Similarly, the token "success"
    is followed by "may nullify", which implies a negative sentiment.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis, such as "wholly", "quickly",
    and "practicable", are identified and increase the sentiment score of the preceding
    token.

    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment, such as "not" and "no", are
    identified and flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of words with negative sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: Ambiguous or neutral words, such as "fine" and "okay",
    are not present in the text, so no special handling is required.


    The text primarily discusses military tactics and strategies, and the language
    used is formal and objective. However, the tone is somewhat negative due to the
    emphasis on preventing enemy success and overcoming obstacles.'
