    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """If a general desires to be a successful actor in the great drama
    of war, his first duty is to study carefully the theater of operations, that he
    may see clearly the relative advantages and disadvantages it presents for himself
    and his enemies. This being done, he can understandingly proceed to prepare his
    base of operations, then to choose the most suitable zone of operations for his
    main efforts, and, in doing so, keep constantly before his mind the principles
    of the art of war relative to lines and fronts of operations. The offensive army
    should particularly endeavor to cut up the opposing army by skillfully selecting
    objective points of maneuver; it will then assume, as the objects of its subsequent
    undertakings, geographical points of more or less importance, depending upon its
    first successes.The defensive army, on the contrary, should endeavor, by all means,
    to neutralize the first forward movement of its adversary, protracting operations
    as long as possible while not compromising the fate of the war, and deferring
    a decisive battle until the time when a portion of the enemy''s forces are either
    exhausted by labors, or scattered for the purpose of occupying invaded provinces,
    masking fortified places, covering sieges, protecting the line of operations,
    depots, &c."""'

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Rule 1: Tokenization - The text is split into individual words, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis - The text contains words like "study", "carefully",
    "understandingly", "prepare", "choose", "principles", "art", "war", "offensive",
    "defensive", which do not have sentiment-bearing words.

    3. Rule 3: Contextual Analysis - No sentiment-bearing words are found, so no sentiment
    scores are flipped.

    4. Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis - No emphasis words are found, so no sentiment scores
    are increased.

    5. Rule 5: Negation Analysis - No negation words are found, so no sentiment scores
    are flipped.

    6. Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation - The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing
    words are found.

    7. Rule 7: Thresholding - Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is
    classified as "neutral".

    8. Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity - No ambiguous or neutral words are found, so no
    adjustments are made to the sentiment score.


    The text appears to be a passage about military strategy and tactics, discussing
    the importance of understanding the theater of operations and preparing for battles.
    The language used is formal and objective, without any emotional or sentiment-bearing
    words, which is why the text is classified as "neutral".'
