    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """General G. H. Thomas, in command of the U.S. Army of the Cumberland,
    refused battle with the Confederates in Nashville until he had prepared cavalry
    and made every other arrangement for pursuit. Constancy of purpose was the salient
    feature of Thomas''s military character. He would not fight until he was ready.
    The civil authorities urgently demanded that he should advance. So great was the
    tension that Grant finally sent General J. A. Logan to supersede Thomas; but before
    Logan arrived Thomas had won the _Battle of Nashville_ (Dec. 15-16, 1864), the
    most crushing victory of the war.Lord Roberts landed in Cape Town on Jan. 10,
    1900, and popular expectation was degenerating into impatience when a co-ordinated
    advance of French''s cavalry and the Sixth and Ninth Infantry Divisions {16} resulted
    in the relief of beleagured cities distant from the field of battle, and in the
    surrender on the field of Cronje''s force at _Paardeberg_ (Feb. 27, 1900), on
    the anniversary of Majuba."""'

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "positive".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "crushing",
    "victory", and "relief", which are assigned a sentiment score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which is positive.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold, so the text
    is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text describes two military victories, the Battle of Nashville and the relief
    of beleaguered cities, which are presented in a positive light. The tone is one
    of triumph and success, which is consistent with a positive sentiment.'
