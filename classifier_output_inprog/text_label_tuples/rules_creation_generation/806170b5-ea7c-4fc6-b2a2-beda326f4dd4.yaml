- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """"It is then essential to work for the development of the moral
    forces of the nation. They alone will sustain the soldier in the distressing test
    of battle where death comes unseen."That is the most important of the lessons
    of the South African war. Small nations will find therein the proof that, in preparing
    their youth for their duties as soldiers and creating in the hearts of all the
    wish for sacrifice, they are certain to live free; but only at this price."This
    profession of faith contradicts the imbecile sophisms foolishly put into circulation
    by high authority and a thoughtless press, on the efficiency of the mass, which
    is nothing but numbers, on the fantastic value of new arms, which are declared
    sufficient for gaining a victory by simple mechanical perfection, on the suppression
    of individual courage. It is almost as though courage had become a superfluous
    and embarrassing factor. Nothing is more likely to poison the army. Ardant du
    Picq is the best specific against the heresies and the follies of ignorance or
    of pedantry. Here are some phrases of unerring truth. They ought to be impressed
    upon all memories, inscribed upon the walls of our military schools. They ought
    to be learned as lessons by our officers and they ought to rule them as regulations
    and pass into their blood:"Man is capable of but a given quantity of fear. To-day
    one must swallow in five minutes the dose that one took in an hour in Turenne''s
    day.""To-day there is greater need than ever for rigid formation.""Who can say
    that he never felt fear in battle? And with modern appliances, with their terrible
    effect on the nervous system, discipline is all the more necessary because one
    fights only in open formation.""Combat exacts a moral cohesion, a solidarity more
    compact that ever before.""""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified, and
    sentiment scores are assigned. For example, "essential", "distressing", "important",
    "proof", "wish", "sacrifice", "free", "imbecile", "sophisms", "foolish", "fantastic",
    "superfluous", "embarrassing", "poison", "unerring", "truth", "rigid", "necessary",
    "compact", and "solidarity" are all sentiment-bearing words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "distressing" is preceded by "test of battle", which is
    a negative context, so its sentiment score is flipped to -1. "Rigid" is followed
    by "formation", which is a positive context, so its sentiment score is increased
    by 0.5.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis, such as "essential", "important",
    and "unerring", are identified, and the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens
    are increased by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment, such as "not" and "never",
    are identified, and the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens are flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive, indicating a
    positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: Ambiguous or neutral words, such as "fine" and "okay",
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score of 0. The text does not contain multiple
    conflicting sentiments, so the sentiment score with the highest magnitude is used.


    Overall, the text expresses a positive sentiment, emphasizing the importance of
    moral forces, individual courage, and discipline in the military.'
