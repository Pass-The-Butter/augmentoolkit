- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """At the battle of =Vionville=,[326] about 5 P. M., four horse and  seven
    field batteries of the IIIrd Army Corps were engaged near  =Flavigny= with ten
    French batteries. After this artillery duel had  lasted half an hour, French Guard
    Infantry advanced to the attack.  This was repulsed by artillery fire at a range
    of 800 m., but the  fire of the artillery was diverted from its proper objective
    by the  advance of this infantry. Similarly, at =St. Privat=, two batteries  of
    the Guard Artillery had to direct their fire on French skirmishers.[326] _Gen
    St. W._, I, p. 557.IX. THE ATTACK.The defense may repulse the enemy, but only
    the attack can annihilate him. The decision as to whether the force is to attack
    or stand on the defensive depends upon the tactical situation and the will of
    the commander, and not upon numerical superiority, of which one is not aware,
    as a rule, until after the battle.[327] Determined attacks, again and again repeated,
    in spite of all failures, are the surest means of gaining victory and of preventing
    the enemy from becoming aware of his superiority. Only pressing reasons (marked
    hostile superiority, necessity for awaiting approaching reinforcements, or the
    failure of an attack), and never favorable terrain conditions, should determine
    a commander to stand on the defensive. In defense the eventual assumption of the
    offensive is kept constantly in view. A commander who voluntarily stands on the
    defensive for the purpose of letting the opponent attack, and then attacks him
    in turn, reaps only the disadvantages and never the advantages of both the offensive
    and the defensive.[327] See _Taktik_, V, p. 121, et seq."""'

- content: 'I will classify the input text as "neutral" according to the rules provided.
    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "bad", etc. Therefore, no sentiment score is assigned to any
    token.


    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain negative words like "not", "never",
    etc. that would flip the sentiment score. It also does not contain positive words
    like "very", "extremely", etc. that would increase the sentiment score.


    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain words that convey emphasis like
    "very", "extremely", "really", etc.


    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain words that negate sentiment like
    "not", "never", "no", etc.


    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment score is assigned to any token, the
    overall sentiment score is 0.


    7. Thresholding: The threshold value is not specified, but since the overall sentiment
    score is 0, the text would not be classified as "positive" or "negative" based
    on this rule.


    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous or neutral words like
    "fine", "okay", etc. that would require special handling.


    Based on the rules, the input text is classified as "neutral" since the overall
    sentiment score is 0.'
