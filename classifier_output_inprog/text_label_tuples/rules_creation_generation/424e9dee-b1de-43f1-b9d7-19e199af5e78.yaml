- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """"If every theater of war forms a figure presenting four faces more   or
    less regular, one of the armies, at the opening of the campaign,   may hold one
    of these faces,--perhaps two,--while the enemy   occupies the other, the fourth
    being closed by insurmountable   obstacles. The different ways of occupying this
    theater will lead   to widely different combinations. To illustrate, we will cite
    the   theater of the French armies in Westphalia from 1757 to 1762, and   that
    of Napoleon in 1806, both of which are represented in Fig. 1,   p. 79. In the
    first case, the side A B was the North Sea, B D the   line of the Weser and the
    base of Duke Ferdinand, C D the line of   the Main and the base of the French
    army, A C the line of the   Rhine, also guarded by French troops. The French held
    two faces,   the North Sea being the third; and hence it was only necessary for   them,
    by maneuvers, to gain the side B D to be masters of the four   faces, including
    the base and the communications of the enemy. The   French army, starting from
    its base C D and gaining the front of   operations F G H, could cut off the allied
    army I from its base B   D; the latter would be thrown upon the angle A, formed
    by the lines   of the Rhine, the Ems, and the sea, while the army E could   communicate
    with its bases on the Main and Rhine."The movement of Napoleon in 1806 on the
    Saale was similar. He   occupied at Jena and Naumburg the line F G H, then marched
    by Halle   and Dessau to force the Prussian army I upon the sea, represented   by
    the side A B. The result is well known."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "the", "and", "of", etc. which
    are neutral. There are no sentiment-bearing words like "happy", "good", "bad",
    etc.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words like "not",
    "never", etc. that would flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis like "very", "extremely",
    etc.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment like "not", "never",
    etc.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since there are no sentiment-bearing
    words, the overall sentiment score is 0.

    7. Thresholding: The threshold value is set to 0.5. Since the overall sentiment
    score is 0, the text is not classified as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains neutral words like "the", "and", "of",
    etc. and no ambiguous or conflicting sentiments.


    The text appears to be a historical military analysis and does not contain any
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would indicate a positive or negative
    sentiment. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
