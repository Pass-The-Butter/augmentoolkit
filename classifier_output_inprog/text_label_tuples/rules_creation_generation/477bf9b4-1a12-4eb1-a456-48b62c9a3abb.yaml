    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"As soon as the flag was raised the march past was begun, and thousands\
    \ of the magnificent-looking troops passed in review before Lord Roberts. The\
    \ British soldiers made a fine show, although they were evidently pretty well\
    \ worn out; their horses, too, were in bad condition. The Colonials and the Gordon\
    \ Highlanders were the most attractive part of the review and made the best showing.\
    \ The naval guns were drawn by many spans of oxen, and looked tremendously business-like.\
    \ Under ordinary conditions the spectacle would have been a sight to fill a spectator\
    \ with enthusiasm and admiration; but, somehow, the scene seemed more an occasion\
    \ of sadness, awakening admiration and pity for that little band of men who had\
    \ marched out into the night only a few hours before. An American business man\
    \ of Pretoria watched the regiments tramp past, and then remarked, \u201CWell,\
    \ I think the best way for the Boers to win out is to come back to-day and march\
    \ in review before this army. They would not need to fight any more, for this\
    \ whole lot would die of shame.\u201DThere was not a very large crowd to witness\
    \ the occupation, considering the number of people in the city, for very few of\
    \ the Boer sympathizers came out, and in most cases the women went into their\
    \ houses, closing the front doors and windows tightly, and many did not open their\
    \ houses until they were forced to come out to attend to their household marketing.\
    \ Along the verandas of the Grand Hotel and in the street in front of the hotel\
    \ a few ladies were to be seen, but except for these the crowd was composed of\
    \ men, mostly blacks. This conspicuous absence of the women served to show the\
    \ bitter feeling and intense hatred that prevailed among the people.The Union\
    \ Bank, however, a British institution, swung out two large Union Jacks in honor\
    \ of the event.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "fine",
    "bad", "sadness", "admiration", "pity", "shame", and "hatred". These words are
    assigned sentiment scores accordingly.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text contains words that affect the sentiment scores,
    such as "not" and "never". These words flip the sentiment scores of preceding
    tokens.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis, such as "tremendously"
    and "very". These words increase the sentiment scores of preceding tokens.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains words that negate sentiment, such as "not"
    and "never". These words flip the sentiment scores of preceding tokens.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains ambiguous or neutral words like "fine"
    and "okay", which are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0). The text also contains
    multiple conflicting sentiments, but the sentiment score with the highest magnitude
    (0) is used.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it contains both positive
    and negative sentiments, but the overall sentiment score is close to 0.'
