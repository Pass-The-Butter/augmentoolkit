- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"[373] This is partly due to the fact that fire cannot be adjusted  quickly\
    \ enough, and that it is difficult to follow moving targets.  Besides, when the\
    \ targets are small and numerous, they are difficult  to hit.The result of this\
    \ procedure will be that the artillery of both sides will engage each other\u2019\
    s attention with only a small part of their guns, and concentrate the remainder\
    \ on the hostile infantry. It is obvious that the infantry will very soon demand\
    \ of its artillery in definite terms that it should first annihilate the hostile\
    \ artillery before the infantry can think of continuing the attack.The provisions\
    \ of the German regulations in regard to the fusion of activities of infantry\
    \ and artillery mark an entirely new departure. The commencement of the infantry\
    \ attack is accordingly no longer dependent upon the result of the artillery combat;\
    \ on the contrary, both combats are of equal importance and proceed along parallel\
    \ lines; the only danger is that the infantry may make a headlong rush to the\
    \ front before a superiority of fire has been gained.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "difficult", "small", "numerous",
    "hit", "annihilate", "inferior", which have neutral sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which are mostly neutral. The score
    is close to 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is close to 0, the text is
    classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text discusses military tactics and strategies, and the language used is formal
    and objective, without any strong emotional tone. Therefore, the classification
    as "neutral" is appropriate.'
