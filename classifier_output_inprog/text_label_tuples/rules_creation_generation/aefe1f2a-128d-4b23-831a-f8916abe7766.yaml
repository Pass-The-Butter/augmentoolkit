- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """The platoon commander indicates the march direction to the leader
    of the base squad, and, accompanied by the range finders and the musicians, moves
    to a point at least ten paces in front of the line of his squad leaders, as a
    rule, opposite the center of his platoon; but he is not restricted to this position.
    He must possess mobility if he desires to lead his platoon skillfully on varied
    ground, if he expects to avoid interfering with neighboring platoons, and if he
    wishes to observe the enemy at the same time. The musician keeps the company commander
    constantly in view. (Par. 221 German I. D. R.). The range finders observe the
    battlefield, estimate the range to any targets appearing in view, without being
    specifically told to do so, communicate the range found to the platoon commander
    (this should not be done by shouting, as misunderstandings might result therefrom),
    and observe the effect of the fire. (Par. 173 German I. D. R.).Whenever the flanks
    of a skirmish line are not protected by other troops or by natural obstacles,
    a few men under a prudent leader should always be sent out as combat patrols to
    the flank, or better still, to the right or left front. The patrol should under
    no circumstances lose connection with the command which it is to protect, but,
    on the other hand, should not stick so close to it that the file on the exposed
    flank is in a position to see as much as the combat patrol itself. As a report
    from a combat patrol frequently arrives too late, or cannot be made at all on
    account of hostile fire, signals should be agreed upon and the leader of the squad
    on the exposed flank of the line should keep the combat patrol constantly in view.
    Signal flags may also be employed advantageously in such cases."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so they
    are assigned a sentiment score of 0.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No tokens are preceded or followed by negative or positive
    words that would flip their sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which is mostly 0. The score is neutral.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found, and there are
    no conflicting sentiments.


    The text appears to be a passage from a military manual, describing tactics and
    strategies for leading a platoon. The language is formal and objective, without
    any emotional tone or sentiment. Therefore, the text is classified as "neutral".'
