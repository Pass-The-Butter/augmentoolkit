    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """The history of the grand army of Boulogne, whose organization seemed
    to leave nothing farther to be desired, proves the assertion just made. The center
    under Soult, the right under Davoust, the left under Ney, and the reserve under
    Lannes, formed together a regular and formidable battle-corps of thirteen divisions
    of infantry, without counting those of the guard and the grenadiers. Besides these,
    the corps of Bernadotte and Marmont detached to the right, and that of Augereau
    to the left, were ready for action on the flanks. But after the passage of the
    Danube at Donauwerth every thing was changed. Ney, at first reinforced to five
    divisions, was reduced to two; the battle-corps was divided partly to the right
    and partly to the left, so that this fine arrangement was destroyed."""'

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words in the text are identified,
    and sentiment scores are assigned. The text contains words like "fine", "regular",
    and "formidable", which have neutral sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. However, there are no negative or positive words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis, so the sentiment
    scores remain unchanged.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment, so the sentiment
    scores remain unchanged.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since the sentiment scores are mostly
    neutral, the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains ambiguous words like "fine", which are
    assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it lacks strong positive
    or negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases.'
