- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """But the particular way in which those stones may be used, the combinations
    into which they may be grouped, the main influences which are to impose themselves
    upon particular great agglomerations of new nationalities are the whole issue
    of the debate, and form the whole subject of this war.The German Empire and its
    Ally, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy--that is, the reigning house of Hapsburg-Lorraine--wants
    the re-arrangement to take a certain form which would leave the German speech
    and culture and tradition the predominating thing in Europe, and probably in the
    whole world.The Allies, upon the other hand, are fighting for a less simple idea.
    They are fighting for the double conception of:(_a_) Retaining the existing independence
    of certain  national groups.(_b_) Erecting other independent or partly independent  groups,
    the existence of which and the general influence  of which shall restrict German
    and in particular Prussian  power.This dual conception the Allies rightly term
    the preservation and the extension of national liberties in Europe.Now before
    we can comprehend either what the Germans are striving for or what the Allies
    are striving for, we must make a catalogue of those national groups which are
    at the foundation of the whole business. In making that catalogue we must remember
    what it is that creates a national group.[Illustration: MAP I. THE MAIN TRUE NATIONAL

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words, so no
    sentiment scores are assigned.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words are found, so no sentiment
    scores are flipped or increased.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing
    words are found.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found, so no adjustments
    are made to the sentiment score.


    The text appears to be a historical or political passage discussing national groups
    and their relationships, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
