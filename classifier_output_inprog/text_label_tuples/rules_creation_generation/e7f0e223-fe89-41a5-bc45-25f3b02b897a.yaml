    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """{97}_He must select a rallying place_ in rear of the main position
    from which to recapture the front line, as General Lee recovered the "Salient"
    in the Wilderness of Virginia._He must arrange for the reorganisation_ of his
    victorious forces and for the pursuit and complete overthrow of the enemy.{98}PROTECTION
    AND RECONNAISSANCE"Surprise consists in the hard fact that the enemy suddenly
    appears in considerable numbers without his presence having been known to be so
    near for want of information; and without it being possible to assemble against
    him for want of protection."--MARSHAL FOCH."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words. However,
    the token "victorious" has a positive sentiment score (+1).

    3. Contextual Analysis: No tokens are preceded by negative words, and no tokens
    are followed by positive words.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No tokens convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: No tokens negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The only positive sentiment score is
    +1 from the token "victorious". The overall sentiment score is +1.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is above the threshold (0.5),
    the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are present in the text.


    However, upon re-examining the text, I realize that the sentiment is actually
    neutral. The text is a historical passage discussing military strategies and quotes
    from Marshal Foch. It does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment.
    Therefore, I revise my classification to "neutral".'
