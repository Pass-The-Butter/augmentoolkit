- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Here lies the origin of that difference of OFFENSIVE and DEFENSIVE,
    the influence of which prevails throughout the whole province of War. We cannot
    at present pursue this subject further than to observe that from this negative
    intention are to be deduced all the advantages and all the stronger forms of combat
    which are on the side of the Defensive, and in which that philosophical-dynamic
    law which exists between the greatness and the certainty of success is realised.
    We shall resume the consideration of all this hereafter.If then the negative purpose,
    that is the concentration of all the means into a state of pure resistance, affords
    a superiority in the contest, and if this advantage is sufficient to BALANCE whatever
    superiority in numbers the adversary may have, then the mere DURATION of the contest
    will suffice gradually to bring the loss of force on the part of the adversary
    to a point at which the political object can no longer be an equivalent, a point
    at which, therefore, he must give up the contest. We see then that this class
    of means, the wearing out of the enemy, includes the great number of cases in
    which the weaker resists the stronger.Frederick the Great, during the Seven Years''
    War, was never strong enough to overthrow the Austrian monarchy; and if he had
    tried to do so after the fashion of Charles the Twelfth, he would inevitably have
    had to succumb himself. But after his skilful application of the system of husbanding
    his resources had shown the powers allied against him, through a seven years''
    struggle, that the actual expenditure of strength far exceeded what they had at
    first anticipated, they made peace."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified, and
    sentiment scores are assigned. For example, "OFFENSIVE" and "DEFENSIVE" have positive
    sentiment scores, while "negative" has a negative sentiment score.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "negative" is preceded by "from this", which is a neutral
    word, so its sentiment score remains negative.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis, such as "then" and "therefore",
    are identified, and the sentiment scores of preceding tokens are increased by
    0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment, such as "not" and "no", are
    identified, and the sentiment scores of preceding tokens are flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of negative sentiment-bearing words and the negation of positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: Ambiguous or neutral words, such as "fine" and "okay",
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0). Conflicting sentiments are not present
    in this text.


    The text primarily discusses the concept of defensive warfare and the importance
    of conserving resources. The tone is analytical and objective, but the sentiment
    is overall negative due to the focus on the difficulties and challenges of war.'
