- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"A corps of correspondents came in with Roberts\u2019s army, and they were\
    \ all very anxious to hear of the events that had occurred on the Boer side. Mr.\
    \ Dinwiddie, of _Harper\u2019s Weekly_, was one of the first in Pretoria; he had\
    \ but recently come over from the Philippines, where he had been with General\
    \ Lawton, but he had seen all the British advance since Bloemfontein. I had last\
    \ seen him during the Cuban campaign. Another veteran of the Santiago campaign\
    \ was Mr. Atkins, of the Manchester _Guardian_. The famous war correspondent,\
    \ Mr. Bennett Burleigh, was also among the first to arrive. He is one of the oldest\
    \ in the profession, and before he began writing he fought with the Confederacy\
    \ during our Civil War. Mr. Barnes and Mr. Jenkins were two more of the American\
    \ correspondents, although they were representing English papers.Some of the wagons\
    \ that were used by the correspondents and the _attach\xE9s_ were grotesque affairs.\
    \ One of them was a pie-wagon, with a door in the back; its possessor had cut\
    \ a hole in the roof and run a stovepipe out so that he could cook in any kind\
    \ of weather. There were a good many grocers\u2019 wagons, but the most common\
    \ conveyance was the two-wheeled Cape cart.As soon as Lord Roberts took possession,\
    \ he issued a conciliatory proclamation, telling the burghers who wished to lay\
    \ down their arms and take the oath binding them to neutrality that they would\
    \ not be made prisoners of war. A number availed themselves of this offer, and\
    \ most of them kept their promises; but subsequent events made many of them take\
    \ up arms again.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "anxious", "very", "fine",
    and "good", which are sentiment-bearing words. However, the overall sentiment
    is neutral, as there are no strongly positive or negative words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words like "very" and "extremely", which
    convey emphasis. However, these words do not significantly impact the overall
    sentiment.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous words like "fine" and
    "good", but these words are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain strongly
    positive or negative sentiments.'
