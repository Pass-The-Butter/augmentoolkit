- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The latter show the action of troop units only in a general way. Action\
    \ in detail and the individual action of the soldier remain enveloped in a cloud\
    \ of dust, in narratives as in reality. Yet these questions must be studied, for\
    \ the conditions they reveal should be the basis of all fighting methods, past,\
    \ present and future.Where can data on these questions be found?We have very few\
    \ records portraying action as clearly as the report on the engagement at the\
    \ Pont de l'H\xF4pital by Colonel Bugeaud. Such stories in even greater detail,\

    \ who knew how to see and knew how to remember, are what is necessary in a study\
    \ of the battle of to-day.The number of killed, the kind and the character of\

    \ them. We want to know how man in general and the Frenchman in particular fought\
    \ yesterday. Under the pressure of danger, impelled by the instinct for self-preservation,\
    \ did he follow, make light of, or forget the methods prescribed or recommended?\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "must", "should", "necessary",
    "important", which are neutral. There are no sentiment-bearing words like "happy",
    "good", "bad", etc.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative or positive words
    that would flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis like "very", "extremely",
    etc.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment like "not", "never",
    etc.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are
    no sentiment-bearing words or words that convey emphasis or negation.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text that
    would affect the classification.


    The text appears to be a historical or academic passage discussing military tactics
    and strategies, and its tone is informative and neutral.'
