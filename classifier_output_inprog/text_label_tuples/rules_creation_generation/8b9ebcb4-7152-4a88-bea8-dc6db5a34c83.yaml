    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """"The plan of a war on the part of the State assuming the offensive
    in those times consisted generally in the conquest of one or other of the enemy''s
    provinces; the plan of the defender was to prevent this. The plan of campaign
    was to take one or other of the enemy''s fortresses, or to prevent one of our
    own being taken; it was only when a battle became unavoidable for this purpose
    that it was sought for and fought. Whoever fought a battle without this unavoidable
    necessity, from mere innate desire of gaining a victory, was reckoned a general
    with too much daring." For armies were too precious to be lightly risked. "Winter
    quarters, in which the mutual relations of the two parties almost entirely ceased,
    formed a distinct limit to the activity which was considered to belong to one
    campaign." "As long as war was universally conducted in this manner, all was considered
    to be in the most regular order." "Thus there was eminence and perfection of every
    kind, and even Field-Marshal Daun, to whom it was chiefly owing that Frederick
    the Great completely attained his object, and Maria Theresa completely failed
    in hers, notwithstanding that could still pass for a great general."Beyond this
    stage of military thought, many in this country have not yet advanced.*    *    *    *    *"""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "reckoned",
    "daring", "eminence", and "perfection", which are assigned sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is analyzed, and the sentiment
    scores are adjusted accordingly. For example, the word "reckoned" is preceded
    by a negative word "was", so its sentiment score is flipped.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The words "eminence", "perfection", and "great" convey emphasis,
    and the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens are increased by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The word "not" is identified, and the sentiment score of
    the preceding token is flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of negative sentiment-bearing words and the flipping of sentiment scores.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains neutral words like "okay", but they do
    not significantly impact the overall sentiment score.


    The text expresses a negative sentiment towards the military thought and actions
    of the past, criticizing the reckless use of armies and the lack of advancement
    in military strategy.'
