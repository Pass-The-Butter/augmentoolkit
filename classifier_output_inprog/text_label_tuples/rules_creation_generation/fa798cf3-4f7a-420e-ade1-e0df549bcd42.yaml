- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    \ 0.70 m. = 75.6 m. \u201E  \u201E In general, double time is considered of little\
    \ value. In Austria double time is to be maintained for periods of two minutes,\
    \ quick time of five minutes duration alternating, up to sixteen minutes, _i.e._,\
    \ until a distance of 1,726 m. has been covered. In Germany, an alternating quick\
    \ and double time march in heavy marching order is prescribed. A different practice\
    \ prevails in Italy. According to the Italian Regulations all troops are to be\
    \ trained to march in double time without rest and without knapsacks for 2 kilometers\
    \ (with knapsacks, 1 km.); _Bersaglieri_ without knapsacks, 3 km. (with knapsacks,\
    \ 1\xB9\u2044\u2082 km.), also without rest (_i.e._, 13 and 16.8 minutes respectively).\
    \ When we consider that in double time with the necessary alternating step, 2,000\
    \ m. can be covered in 17 minutes, and in accelerated step, in 19-20 minutes,\
    \ the time gained is unimportant when compared to the fatigue of the men and the\
    \ exertion of the lungs, which interferes with deliberate, accurate firing. During\
    \ an Austrian firing test the number of hits fell from 76.5%, attained while advancing\
    \ in quick time, to 51% after a period of double time.The run, without keeping\
    \ step (_Marsch! Marsch!_) is employed in rapidly crossing short, fire-swept spaces,\
    \ in changing quickly from one formation to another, and in the charge.5. MOVEMENTS\

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so their
    sentiment scores are neutral (0).

    3. Contextual Analysis: No tokens are preceded by negative words, and no tokens
    are followed by positive words, so no sentiment scores are flipped.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which are mostly neutral (0). The score
    is close to 0, indicating a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is above the threshold (0.5),
    the text is not classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found, and no conflicting
    sentiments are detected.


    The text appears to be a factual description of military regulations and procedures,
    with no apparent emotional tone or sentiment. Therefore, I classify the text as
    "neutral".'
