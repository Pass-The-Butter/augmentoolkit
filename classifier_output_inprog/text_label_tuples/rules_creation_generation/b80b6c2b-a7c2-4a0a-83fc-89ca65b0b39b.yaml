    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Amongst the ancients, and then again during the early period of
    standing Armies, the expression that we had offered battle to the enemy in vain,
    had more sense in it than it has now. By the ancients everything was constituted
    with a view to measuring each other''s strength in the open field free from anything
    in the nature of a hindrance,(*) and the whole Art of War consisted in the organisation,
    and formation of the Army, that is in the order of battle.(*) Note the custom
    of sending formal challenges, fix time   and place for action, and "enhazelug"
    the battlefield in   Anglo-Saxon times.--ED.Now as their Armies regularly entrenched
    themselves in their camps, therefore the position in a camp was regarded as something
    unassailable, and a battle did not become possible until the enemy left his camp,
    and placed himself in a practicable country, as it were entered the lists.If therefore
    we hear about Hannibal having offered battle to Fabius in vain, that tells us
    nothing more as regards the latter than that a battle was not part of his plan,
    and in itself neither proves the physical nor moral superiority of Hannibal; but
    with respect to him the expression is still correct enough in the sense that Hannibal
    really wished a battle."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "vain",
    "strong", and "unassailable", but they are not strong enough to determine a clear
    sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the sentiment-bearing
    words are not strong enough to determine a clear sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold, so the text
    is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text discusses the concept of offering battle in vain and the tactics of ancient
    armies, but it does not express a clear sentiment. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
