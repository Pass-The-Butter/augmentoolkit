- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """The aim of every commander who possesses the power of manoeuvre
    is to seek out the enemy and destroy his organised forces. The Attack is the culminating
    point of all manoeuvres to this end, and every commander will endeavour to achieve
    his aim by a sudden and unexpected assault on a part of the enemy''s defences.The
    achievement of this aim is only possible when a commander has assembled a sufficient
    force for his purpose, and has obtained, by reconnaissance and by fighting, information
    as to the vulnerability of the hostile position. The commander will then endeavour
    to break the enemy''s formation so suddenly as to disconcert all his plans; to
    retain a compact force with which to follow up the blow without giving the enemy
    a moment''s breathing space; to drive a wedge into the heart of his disordered
    masses, forcing his wings asunder; and to pursue and annihilate the scattered
    forces of the enemy."Unless a decision is quickly obtained in the opening weeks
    of a modern campaign the opposing armies tend to become immobile, chiefly owing
    to the great power conferred on the defence by modern armaments. The armies will
    then be distributed in great depth, and the attackers are faced with the necessity
    of breaking through not one position only, but a series of positions, extending

    Nations of Britain, France, and Belgium, reinforced at the close by Portuguese

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "destroy",
    "vulnerability", "disconcert", "annihilate", and "immobile", which are assigned
    sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text''s context is analyzed to determine the sentiment
    of each token. For example, the word "destroy" is preceded by the word "seek",
    which has a positive sentiment, so the sentiment score of "destroy" is flipped
    to -1.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis like "suddenly",
    "extremely", and "really", which increase the sentiment score of the preceding
    token.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains words that negate sentiment like "not",
    "never", and "no", which flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of words like "destroy", "vulnerability", and "annihilate".

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains ambiguous or neutral words like "fine"
    and "okay", which are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    The text primarily discusses military strategies and tactics, and the sentiment
    is overwhelmingly negative due to the use of words like "destroy", "vulnerability",
    and "annihilate".'
