    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """German science has given birth to gigantic cannon which no law
    forbids (we shall speak of these further on), but German science will bear, in
    the judgment of History, the responsibility of having added to the horrors of
    war an unprecedented ferocity and savagery by the introduction of asphyxiating
    gases, tear-producing gases, and burning liquids.But we may add that Germany in
    her turn already suffers greatly herself from her inventions; the Allies having
    been compelled to adopt and use similar and often much improved weapons.=3. Fighting
    units.= The fighting units are composed of a variable number of tactical units.
    The tactical unit is the Division, the composition of which will hereafter be
    described. It includes infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers. It ought to
    possess also, and we hope it will soon, a special service of aviation.A group
    of two or three and sometimes four Divisions constitutes an Army Corps. The union
    of three, four, or five Army Corps forms an Army. In this war, two or three armies
    placed under one Command form an Army Group. Four or five of these Army Groups
    exist on the French Front. The general organization of the British differs but
    little from that of the French armies. Whatever difference there may be exists
    rather in the organization of the rear than in that of the front. The British
    occupying a much shorter front, dispose of a proportionately larger number of
    men. Though the bulk of their forces have been but a short time in France, they
    have received from their women workers very intelligent and valuable assistance,
    and, having at their disposal larger appropriations of money, have been able to
    do much more than France towards perfecting the organization at the rear."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "horrors",
    "ferocity", "savagery", and "suffers greatly". These words are assigned a sentiment
    score of -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of sentiment-bearing words with a negative sentiment score.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text primarily discusses the horrors and ferocity of war, the introduction
    of asphyxiating gases, and the suffering caused by these inventions. The tone
    is critical and negative, which is reflected in the classification.'
