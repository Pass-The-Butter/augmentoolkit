- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """In the pursuit of Massena, in 1810, it was important to the English
    to cross the Guadiana, and attack the French before Badajos could be put in a
    state of defence. Beresford was directed by Wellington to pass this river at Jerumina,
    where the Portuguese had promised to furnish pontons; but they neglected to fulfil
    their engagement, and the army had to wait till Capt. Squire, an able and efficient
    officer of engineers, could construct other means for effecting a passage. Every
    thing was done that genius could devise and industry execute; nevertheless, the
    operations of the army were greatly delayed--"_a delay,_" says the historian,
    "_that may be considered as the principal cause of those long and bloody operations
    which afterwards detained Lord Wellington more than a year on the frontiers of
    Portugal._"We might prolong these remarks by discussing the passages of the Ceira
    and Alva, and their influence on the pursuit of Massena; Wellington''s passage
    of the Tagus, and his retreat from Burgos in 1812; the passage of the Adour and
    Garonne in 1814; and the failure of the mines to blow up the bridges of Saltador,
    Alcantara, &c.; but a sufficient number of examples, it is believed, has already
    been adduced to show the advantage of maintaining a properly organized and instructed
    body of sappers, miners, and pontoniers, and the fatal results attending the want
    of such troops, as a component part of an army organization."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "important",
    "able", "efficient", "long", "bloody", etc. These words are assigned a sentiment
    score of +1 or -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score of the sentiment-bearing words.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is close to 0, the text is
    classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text appears to be a historical passage discussing military operations and
    strategies, and it does not contain any strongly positive or negative sentiment.
    Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
