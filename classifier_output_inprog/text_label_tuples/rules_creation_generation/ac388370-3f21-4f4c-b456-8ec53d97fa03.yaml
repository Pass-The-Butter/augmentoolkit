  role: system
- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "reasonable", "gross profits",
    "royalty", "refund", which do not have a clear positive or negative sentiment.
    However, the text also contains words like "must", "required", "discontinue",
    which have a neutral sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text
    contains both neutral and objective language.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous words, but they are not
    critical to the overall sentiment.


    The text appears to be a legal agreement or contract, and its language is formal
    and objective, which is why it is classified as "neutral".'
