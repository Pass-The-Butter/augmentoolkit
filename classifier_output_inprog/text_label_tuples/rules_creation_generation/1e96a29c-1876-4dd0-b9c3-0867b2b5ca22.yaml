- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Work and wages the State _must_ guarantee during modern war, and
    before the State _can_ guarantee these, it is absolutely necessary that it should
    satisfy itself that the above preparations are actually _in being_. This pre-supposes
    a more earnest study of the industrial effects of a great national war than has
    yet been given to the subject by our political leaders. For in the warfare of
    the present and future the importance of gaining and preserving Public Opinion,
    as pointed out by Clausewitz, cannot be over-estimated. It is as fundamentally
    important _to safeguard our own Public Opinion as it is to attack, weaken, and
    gain over that of the enemy_. This has not yet passed the stage of thought. But
    good thoughts are no better than good dreams unless they be put into action. We
    are waiting for the statesman to DO it. There is no great difficulty.(2) In arousing
    the national spirit to the requisite height of patriotic self-denial and self-sacrifice,
    in elevating, preserving, and safe-guarding Public Opinion during a great national
    struggle, much may be hoped for from the patriotism of our Press. Only in fairness
    to those whose patriotism is self-originating and spontaneous, it must be made
    compulsory upon ALL, so that no journal may suffer loss of circulation or pecuniary
    injury thereby.(3) There lies a practical task immediately to the hand of our
    statesmen if they will seriously set themselves to the task of improving the _moral_
    of our nation by reforming our education _curriculum_, on the leading principle
    that the moral is to the physical as three to one in life, and that therefore
    character-building must be its chief aim. Then they will do much towards strengthening
    us for war, towards carrying out Clausewitz''s idea of the gaining and preserving
    of our Public Opinion in War.CHAPTER VIITHE NATURE OF WAR"""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "good",
    "patriotic", "self-denial", and "self-sacrifice", which are assigned a sentiment
    score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text contains phrases that convey a positive sentiment,
    such as "good thoughts are no better than good dreams unless they be put into
    action" and "much may be hoped for from the patriotism of our Press". These phrases
    are assigned a sentiment score of +1.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis, such as "very"
    and "extremely", which increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by
    0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive, indicating a
    positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value, so
    the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous or neutral words, and
    there are no conflicting sentiments.


    The text expresses a positive sentiment towards the idea of patriotism, self-denial,
    and self-sacrifice, and encourages statesmen to take action to improve the moral
    of the nation and strengthen the country for war.'
