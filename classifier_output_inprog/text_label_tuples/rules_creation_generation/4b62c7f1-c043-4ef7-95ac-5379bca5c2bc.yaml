- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """I must also call attention to Article XXVIII., upon great detachments.
    These are necessary evils, and, if not managed with great care, may prove ruinous
    to the best armies. The essential rules on this point are, to make as few detachments
    as possible, _to have them readily movable_, to draw them back to the main body
    as soon as practicable, and to give them good instructions for avoiding disasters.I
    have nothing to say relative to the first two chapters on military policy; for
    they are themselves nothing more than a brief summary of this part of the art
    of war, which chiefly concerns statesmen, but should be thoroughly understood
    by military men. I will, however, invite special attention to Article XIV., relating
    to the command of armies or to the choice of generals-in-chief,--a subject worthy
    the most anxious care upon the part of a wise government; for upon it often depends
    the safety of the nation.We may be confident that a good strategist will make
    a good chief of staff for an army; but for the command in chief is required a
    man of tried qualities, of high character and known energy. The united action
    of two such men as commander-in-chief and chief of staff, when a great captain
    of the first order cannot be had, may produce the most brilliant results.FOOTNOTES:[Footnote
    53: The objective may be in some degree _political_,--especially in cases of wars
    of intervention in the affairs of another country; but it then really becomes
    geographical.]"""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "great",
    "care", "good", "bad", "ruinous", "disasters", "wise", "high", "known", "energy",
    and "brilliant". However, these words do not have a strong positive or negative
    sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the sentiment-bearing
    words do not have a strong positive or negative sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text discusses military strategy and tactics, and while it mentions some positive
    and negative aspects, the overall tone is neutral and informative.'
