    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """ainly of infantry, with artillery and machine guns, and the troops
    will move in the order in which they will come into action. The Vanguard will
    be preceded by scouts, special attention being paid to roads and tracks parallel
    with the advance. This screen is followed by the remainder of the Vanguard, in
    collected formation, until it is in contact with or in the vicinity of the enemy,
    with protection at all times against local surprise. The Main Guard follows, in
    touch with the Vanguard, and with local protection. Both portions have definite
    commanders, and the commander of the whole Advanced Guard will probably move with
    the supports of the Vanguard. The commander will also determine the _relative
    distances_ between the Vanguard and the Main Guard, these being regulated by the
    strength of the Advanced Guard, and being based upon the necessity of one part
    supporting the other. The distance of the {107} Advanced Guard ahead of the Main
    Body may have been mentioned in the operation orders, but if it is left to the
    discretion of the Advanced Guard commander he will be guided solely by the interests
    of the force he is covering, and his decision will be influenced by the nature
    of the country (whether it is open, or intersected by woods, hedges, sunken roads,
    etc., which make observation even by aircraft a matter of great difficulty) and
    by the tactical situation, such distance being chosen as will suit these conditions,
    while admitting the fulfilment of the objects in view, viz.:--to obtain information
    concerning the enemy and to prevent hostile reconnaissance; to prevent surprise
    and delay; and to enable the Main Body to deploy into battle formation without
    interruption by the enemy''s fire."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "infantry", "artillery", "machine
    guns", "scouts", "enemy", which do not have a sentiment-bearing word. Therefore,
    no sentiment score is assigned to these tokens.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative or positive words
    that would flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment scores are assigned to the tokens,
    the overall sentiment score is 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text that
    would affect the classification.


    The text appears to be a military document discussing the organization and movement
    of troops, and does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would
    indicate a positive or negative sentiment.'
