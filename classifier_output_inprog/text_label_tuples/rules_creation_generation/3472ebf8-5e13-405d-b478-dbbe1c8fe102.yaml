- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The close formation of men armed with pikes was irresistible so long as\
    \ it was maintained. A forest of pikes fifteen to eighteen feet long kept you\
    \ at a distance. [25] On the other hand it was easy to kill off the cavalry and\
    \ light infantry about the phalanx, which was an unwieldy mass marching with a\
    \ measured step, and which a mobile body of troops could always avoid. Openings\
    \ in the phalanx might be occasioned by marching, by the terrain, by the thousand\
    \ accidents of struggle, by the individual assault of brave men, by the wounded\
    \ on the ground creeping under the high held pikes and cutting at the legs of\
    \ the front rank. Men in the phalanx could scarcely see and even the first two\
    \ lines hardly had a free position for striking. The men were armed with long\
    \ lances, useless at close quarters, good only for combat at shaft's length (Polybius).\
    \ They were struck with impunity by the groups [26] which threw themselves into\
    \ the intervals. And then, once the enemy was in the body of the phalanx, morale\
    \ disappeared and it became a mass without order, a flock of panic-stricken sheep\
    \ falling over each other.In a mob hard-pressed men prick with their knives those\
    \ who press them. The contagion of fear changes the direction of the human wave;\
    \ it bends back upon itself and breaks to escape danger. If, then, the enemy fled\
    \ before the phalanx there was no m\xEAl\xE9e. If he gave way tactically before\
    \ it and availing himself of gaps penetrated it by groups, still there was no\
    \ m\xEAl\xE9e or mixture of ranks. The wedge entering into a mass does not become\
    \ intermingled with it.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "irresistible", "easy", "unwieldy",
    "accidents", "struggle", "brave", "wounded", "high", "long", "good", "useless",
    "impunity", "morale", "order", "fear", "danger", "tactically", "gaps", "penetrated",
    "groups", "wedge", "mass", which do not have a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative or positive words
    that would flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis, so no sentiment
    score is increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment, so no sentiment
    score is flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are
    no clear positive or negative sentiments in the text.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains neutral words like "fine", "okay", etc.,
    which are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    The text appears to be a descriptive passage about the phalanx formation and its
    weaknesses, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
