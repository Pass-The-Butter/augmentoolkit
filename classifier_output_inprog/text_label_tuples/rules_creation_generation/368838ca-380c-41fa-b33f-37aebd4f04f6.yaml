- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The greatest obstacle to infantry reconnaissance lies in the fact that\
    \ its cyclists are confined to good roads; that its mounted officers cannot be\
    \ withdrawn from their appropriate duties except for short periods; that, as a\
    \ rule, orderlies are not available for carrying messages; and that, if officers\
    \ carry messages in person, the reconnaissance is interrupted. Infantry patrols,\
    \ on account of the slowness of their movements, cannot transmit messages quickly,\
    \ and, as a result, such messages frequently arrive too late to be of any value.\
    \ On the other hand, infantry patrols possess an advantage in that, by utilizing\
    \ cover, they can get close to the enemy without being observed. The need of local\
    \ reconnaissance is greater now than it was in the past, because troops can no\
    \ longer change front when deployed, and because those which come under hostile\
    \ fire while in close order formations may, in a short time, suffer well-nigh\
    \ annihilating losses.In the South African war the British infantry was frequently\
    \ placed  in difficult situations by the suddenly delivered fire of the Boers\
    \  (=Magersfontain=, =Colenso=), which induced it to deploy all of its  lines\
    \ on a wide front at an early moment.The Japanese attached much importance to\
    \ local reconnaissance,  whereas the Russian leaders considered it as something\
    \ unusual, so  that Kuropatkin was finally obliged to prescribe it in army orders.\
    \  \u201CLocal reconnaissance was performed by 20 to 30 infantrymen. These  carefully\
    \ approached our positions in small groups. One man of each  group laid his rifle\
    \ aside and crawled close up to our trenches,  raised his head and observed, while\
    \ three or four of his companions,  whom he had left farther in rear, opened fire\
    \ on the trenches.  Occasionally all of these men threw themselves flat on the\
    \ ground for  protection. This mode of procedure continued for seven hours.\u201D\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words and punctuation marks
    were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "obstacle",
    "confined", "slow", "interrupted", "annihilating", and "difficult". These words
    have a negative sentiment score of -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that flip the sentiment
    score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is predominantly negative,
    with a few neutral tokens.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text primarily discusses the challenges and difficulties faced by infantry
    reconnaissance, including the limitations of good roads, slow movements, and the
    need for local reconnaissance. The tone is critical and negative, highlighting
    the obstacles and difficulties faced by infantry patrols.'
