- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"If the attacker is unable to hide from the defender\u2019s fire by using\
    \ cover, his losses will increase until they become unbearable; his attack will\
    \ hesitate, and he will commence firing. Fresh troops are necessary to carry the\
    \ attacking line forward anew. The success of the defense is assured, if the defender\
    \ is able to prevent the attacking force from getting within short range of the\
    \ position. The defender\u2019s chance of making a successful counter-attack disappears,\
    \ however, as soon as the attacking force makes a lodgment within short range\
    \ of the position; for the closer the defender is pressed, the closer will he\
    \ be tied to his position. While the superiority of fire enjoyed by the defender\
    \ at mid ranges allows him perfect freedom of action, at short ranges the attacker\u2019\
    s fire imposes conditions upon the defense which make the growing power of the\
    \ attack sensibly felt. The moment the defender begins firing, however, he becomes\
    \ at once a favorable target for the artillery of the attacking force. The defender\
    \ frequently betrays his position prematurely by opening fire.The _moral effect_\
    \ of withholding the fire (_fire surprise_) is very great.[144] A strong fire\
    \ will be actually annihilating if suddenly directed upon the enemy at short ranges,\
    \ especially if he is still in unsuitable formations, owing to his ignorance of\
    \ the defender\u2019s position. (Example: The British brigade under Hart at Colenso,\
    \ 15th Dec., 1899, and the Highland Brigade at Magersfontain, 11th Dec., 1899)\
    \ or if the morale of his troops is questionable.[145] What good troops should\
    \ do in such a situation (employ rapid fire and then advance to the assault) is\
    \ shown by the conduct of the IInd Battalion of the 20th Infantry at Coulomiers.[146]\
    \ Steady nerves and iron discipline are, however, prerequisites for the execution\
    \ of a fire surprise by the defender.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "unbearable",
    "hesitate", "success", "assured", "superiority", "perfect", "growing", "sensibly",
    "great", "annihilating", "unsuitable", "questionable", "good", "rapid", "assault",
    "steady", and "iron". These words have sentiment scores assigned to them.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text contains contextual information that affects
    the sentiment scores. For example, the word "unbearable" is preceded by "increase",
    which flips its sentiment score to positive.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains emphasis words such as "very", "extremely",
    and "really", which increase the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains negation words such as "not" and "no",
    which flip the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive, indicating a
    positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value, so
    the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous or neutral words, but
    they do not significantly affect the overall sentiment score.


    Overall, the text has a positive sentiment score due to the presence of words
    with positive connotations, such as "success", "assured", "superiority", and "great".
    The text also highlights the importance of discipline and steady nerves in achieving
    a successful defense, which adds to its positive tone.'
