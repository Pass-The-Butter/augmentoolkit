- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"It strikes me that, in a situation like that of the French army previous\
    \ to the battle of Leipzig, a general should never calculate upon any of those\
    \ lucky chances which may arise out of a return to the offensive, but that he\
    \ should rather adopt every possible means to secure his retreat. With this view,\
    \ he should immediately cover himself with good entrenchments, to enable him to\
    \ repel with inferior numbers the attack of the enemy, while his own equipments\
    \ are crossing the river. As fast as the troops reach the other side, they should\
    \ occupy positions to protect the passage of the rear guard, and this last should\
    \ be covered by a _t\xEAte de pont_ as soon as the army breaks up its camp. During\
    \ the wars of the Revolution, too little regard was paid to entrenchments; and\
    \ it is for this reason we have seen large armies dispersed after a single reverse,\
    \ and the fate of nations compromised by the issue of one battle.MAXIM XXVI.It\
    \ is contrary to all true principle, to make corps, which have no communication\
    \ with each other, act separately against a central force whose communications\
    \ are cut off.NOTE.The Austrians lost the battle of Hohenlinden by neglecting\
    \ this principle. The imperial army, under the orders of the archduke John, was\
    \ divided into four columns, which had to march through an immense forest, previous\
    \ to their junction in the plain of Anzing, where they intended to surprise the\
    \ French. But these different corps, having no direct communication, found themselves\
    \ compelled to engage separately with an enemy who had taken the precaution of\
    \ concentrating his masses, and who could move them with facility in a country\
    \ with which he had been long previously acquainted.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain many sentiment-bearing words,
    but it does contain some words with neutral sentiment, such as "should", "can",
    and "may".

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain many words that would flip the
    sentiment score, but it does contain some words that convey emphasis, such as
    "too" and "very".

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The sentiment score of the preceding token is increased
    by 0.5 when it is followed by an emphasis word.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain many words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous or neutral words, but
    they do not significantly affect the overall sentiment score.


    The text appears to be a historical passage discussing military strategy and tactics,
    and it does not contain strong emotional language or sentiment. Therefore, it
    is classified as "neutral".'
