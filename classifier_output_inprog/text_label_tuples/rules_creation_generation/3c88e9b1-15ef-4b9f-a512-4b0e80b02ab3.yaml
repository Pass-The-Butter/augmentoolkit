- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

- content: I would classify the input text as "neutral". The text appears to be a
    passage from a book or article discussing military strategy and tactics, and it
    does not contain any overtly positive or negative language. The tone is informative
    and analytical, with no emotional language or sentiment-bearing words that would
    suggest a positive or negative sentiment. The text also does not contain any words
    that convey emphasis or negation, which would further support a neutral classification.
