    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Allusion has already been made to the weakness of Mexico, resulting
    from her want of sea-coast defences, as shown by the war between that republic
    and the United States. This would have been still more manifest had she possessed
    any thing like a commercial marine, exposed to capture by our naval forces. As
    it was, the Mexican war afforded not a single contest between ships and forts,
    no opposition being made to the occupation of Mexican ports by our naval force.
    The only coast defence, the castle of San Juan d''Ulica was not attacked, but
    after the bombardment and capture of Vera Cruz, it surrendered without a blow.The
    Crimean war, on the contrary, exhibited in a most marked degree the importance
    of a well-fortified sea-coast. Notwithstanding the immense force of the combined
    fleets of England and France, no naval attack was made upon either Cronstadt or
    Sebastopol, and the large naval force of Russia proved utterly useless as a defence
    against a maritime descent. There was, indeed, a simulachre of a "naval cannonade"
    on the latter place on the 17th of October, 1854, intended as a diversion of the
    attention and strength of the garrison from the land side, where the real struggle
    for predominance was going on between the besieged and the besiegers. The inutility
    of this attempt was so manifest that no serious naval attack was undertaken, notwithstanding
    that the allies were ready to bring to bear upon the antiquated and ill-armed
    Russian works the most powerful naval armaments the world had ever seen.The results
    of this "simulachre of a naval cannonade," as it has been called, is worthy of
    note. The details are taken from Major Barnard''s able pamphlet on "The Dangers
    and Defences of New York," and Commander Dahlgren''s interesting and valuable
    work on "Shells and Shell Guns.""""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "weakness", "want", "war",
    "capture", "bombardment", "capture", "surrender", "importance", "naval", "attack",
    "defence", "simulachre", "inutility", which do not have a clear positive or negative
    sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text
    does not contain any sentiment-bearing words with a clear positive or negative
    sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0), so the
    text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains neutral words like "simulachre" and "inutility",
    which are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    The text appears to be a historical analysis of naval warfare and coastal defences,
    and does not contain any strong positive or negative sentiment.'
