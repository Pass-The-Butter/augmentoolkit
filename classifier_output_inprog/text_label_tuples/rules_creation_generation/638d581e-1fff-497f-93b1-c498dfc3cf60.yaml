- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The attack may take various forms, depending upon whether the dispositions\
    \ have to be made under hostile fire (surprise and rencontre), or whether the\
    \ enemy has renounced the initiative and awaits the attack in a deployed formation,\
    \ or in a position prepared for defense (deliberately planned attack). In the\
    \ last case the attack requires more careful preparation and in many instances\
    \ even necessitates the employment of special auxiliaries (such as guns capable\
    \ of high angle fire, and engineer trains). However, the advance of a strong firing\
    \ line to within assaulting distance of the enemy, and the uninterrupted fight\
    \ for the superiority of fire, are common to all attacks.Aside from the attack\
    \ against an enemy in position and the rencontre there is an attack formation\
    \ more closely resembling the rencontre in character, which may be called the\
    \ _abridged attack_.[328] This attack formation is used in forestalling the enemy\
    \ in occupying important points, in preventing enveloping movements, in carrying\
    \ out flank attacks, in surprising the enemy, in warding off a hostile surprise,\
    \ in relieving the pressure on a neighboring force, etc. It is moreover appropriate\
    \ where the conformation of the ground or the time of day prohibit a use of the\
    \ rifle.[328] _Abgek\xFCrzter Angriff_.The first stages of the fight of the 6th\
    \ Infantry Division at  =Vionville= are of this character. The fire fight was\
    \ relegated to  the background in view of the constant movement to the front.\
    \ The  situation prohibited our properly taking advantage of our superior  marksmanship.--The\
    \ attack on the railroad cut of =Nuits=, during the  late afternoon of December\
    \ 18th, 1870, progressed similarly.[329][329] KUNZ, _Gefecht von Nuits_, p. 19,\
    \ et seq.1. THE SURPRISE.[330][330] See _Taktik_, V, p. 190.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so their
    sentiment scores are 0.

    3. Contextual Analysis: There are no negative words preceding or following any
    tokens, so no sentiment scores are flipped.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis, so no sentiment
    scores are increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment, so no sentiment
    scores are flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which is 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is not classified
    as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words, and no conflicting
    sentiments.


    The text appears to be a military document discussing various attack formations
    and tactics, and does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that
    would indicate a positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, it is classified as
    "neutral".'
