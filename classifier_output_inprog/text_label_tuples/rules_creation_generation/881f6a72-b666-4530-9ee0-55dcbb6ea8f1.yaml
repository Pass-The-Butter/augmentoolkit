- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """COVERING FIRE.--The energetic and determined support of the infantry
    by fire is the main duty of machine-gun units throughout the whole course of the
    battle. In the attack, machine-gun platoons, Lewis gun sections, {44} or rifle
    sections detailed to give covering fire, must take care to select as targets those
    bodies of the enemy whose fire is chiefly checking the advance. Machine-gun platoons
    are sometimes brigaded, and at others left to battalion commanders, and their
    action after a temporary success in providing covering fire may depend upon their
    tactical distribution at the time. Infantry platoons detailed to give covering
    fire must join in the advance as soon as their own fire ceases to be effective
    in aiding the forward troops, unless definite orders to the contrary have been
    received.FIRE AND MOVEMENT.--It is thus seen that Fire and Movement are inseparably
    associated, and judiciously employed in combination they enable infantry to achieve
    its object in battle, to bring such a superiority of fire to bear as to make an
    advance to close quarters possible, so that the enemy may be induced to surrender
    or may be overwhelmed by a bayonet assault; and to prepare by similar means for
    further advances, until the enemy is entirely hemmed in or completely routed.[1]
    In fiction, this point (that the generalissimo must not allow his sense of proportion
    to be distorted by local successes or reverses) is clearly brought out in _The
    Point of View_, a story in "The Green Curve" by Ole-Luk-Oie (General Swinton).{45}TYPES

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "bad", etc. However, it does contain words related to military
    actions and tactics, which do not carry sentiment.


    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain negative or positive words that
    would affect the sentiment score of individual tokens.


    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.


    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.


    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since the text does not contain sentiment-bearing words
    or words that convey emphasis or negation, the overall sentiment score is neutral
    (0).


    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified
    as "neutral" regardless of the threshold value.


    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous or neutral words, and
    there are no conflicting sentiments.


    The input text is a passage about military tactics and strategies, and it does
    not express a clear positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
