    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"Never for a second did Ardant du Picq forget that combat is the object,\
    \ the cause of being, the supreme manifestation of armies. Every measure which\
    \ departs therefrom, which relegates it to the middle ground is deceitful, chimerical,\
    \ fatal. All the resources accumulated in time of peace, all the tactical evolutions,\
    \ all the strategical calculations are but conveniences, drills, reference marks\
    \ to lead up to it. His obsession was so overpowering that his presentation of\
    \ it will last as long as history. This obsession is the r\xF4le of man in combat.\
    \ Man is the incomparable instrument whose elements, character, energies, sentiments,\
    \ fears, desires, and instincts are stronger than all abstract rules, than all\
    \ bookish theories. War is still more of an art than a science. The inspirations\
    \ which reveal and mark the great strategists, the leaders of men, form the unforeseen\
    \ element, the divine part. Generals of genius draw from the human heart ability\
    \ to execute a surprising variety of movements which vary the routine; the mediocre\
    \ ones, who have no eyes to read readily therein, are doomed to the worst errors.\"\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing\
    \ words. Some examples include:\n\t* \"fatal\" (negative)\n\t* \"deceitful\" (negative)\n\
    \t* \"chimerical\" (negative)\n\t* \"fears\" (negative)\n\t* \"worst\" (negative)\n\
    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its\
    \ sentiment. For example:\n\t* \"Never\" is preceded by a negative word (\"for\
    \ a second\"), so its sentiment score is flipped to positive.\n\t* \"fatal\" is\
    \ preceded by a negative word (\"deceitful\"), so its sentiment score is increased.\n\
    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis are identified, such as \"incomparable\"\
    \ and \"divine\". The sentiment score of the preceding token is increased by 0.5.\n\
    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment are identified, such as \"not\"\
    \ and \"no\". The sentiment score of the preceding token is flipped.\n6. Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the prevalence of\
    \ negative sentiment-bearing words.\n7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score\
    \ is below the threshold (0.5), so the text is classified as \"negative\".\n8.\
    \ Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are identified in the text.\n\
    \nThe text is classified as \"negative\" due to the prevalence of negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words, such as \"fatal\", \"deceitful\", and \"worst\", as well as the overall\
    \ negative tone of the passage."
