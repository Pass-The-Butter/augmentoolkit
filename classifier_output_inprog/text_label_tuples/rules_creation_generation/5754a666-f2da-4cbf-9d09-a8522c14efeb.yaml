- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The court of Vienna had the greatest interest in the war, for family reasons,\
    \ as well as on account of the dangers to which a reverse might subject her provinces.\
    \ For some reason, difficult to understand, Austria co-operated only to the extent\
    \ of thirty battalions: forty-five thousand men remained as an army of observation\
    \ in Brisgau, on the Rhine, and in Flanders. Where were the imposing armies she\
    \ afterward displayed? and what more useful disposition could have been made of\
    \ them than to protect the flanks of the invading army? This remarkable conduct\
    \ on the part of Austria, which cost her so much, may account for the resolution\
    \ of Prussia to retire at a later period, and quit the field, as she did, at the\
    \ very moment when she should have entered it. During the campaign the Prussians\
    \ did not exhibit the activity necessary for success. They spent eight days uselessly\
    \ in camp at Kons. If they had anticipated Dumouriez at the Little Islands, or\
    \ had even made a more serious effort to drive him from them, they would still\
    \ have had all the advantage of a concentrated force against several scattered\
    \ divisions, and could have prevented their junction and overthrown them separately.\
    \ Frederick the Great would have justified the remark of Dumouriez at Grandpr\xE9\
    ,--that, if his antagonist had been the great king, he (Dumouriez) would already\
    \ have been driven behind Ch\xE2lons.The Austrians in this campaign proved that\
    \ they were still imbued with the false system of Daun and Lascy, of covering\
    \ every point in order to guard every point.The fact of having twenty thousand\
    \ men in Brisgau while the Moselle and Sarre were uncovered, shows the fear they\
    \ had of losing a village, and how their system led to large detachments, which\
    \ are frequently the ruin of armies.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "greatest", "dangers", "difficult", "remarkable", "cost", "resolution",
    "activity", "useless", "serious", "advantage", "concentrated", "scattered", "separate",
    "overthrown", "false", "fear", "ruin" have positive or negative sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Tokens are analyzed in context to determine their sentiment.
    For example, "difficult to understand" flips the sentiment score of "Austria co-operated
    only to the extent of thirty battalions" from positive to negative.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis are identified. For example,
    "remarkable", "serious", "useful" increase the sentiment score of the preceding
    token.

    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment are identified. For example,
    "not", "never", "no" flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the prevalence
    of negative sentiment-bearing words.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: Ambiguous or neutral words are assigned a neutral sentiment
    score (0). In this case, there are no such words.


    The text is classified as "negative" due to the prevalence of negative sentiment-bearing
    words and the negative sentiment scores assigned to tokens in context.'
