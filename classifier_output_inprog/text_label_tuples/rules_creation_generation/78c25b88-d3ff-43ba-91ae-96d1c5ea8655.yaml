- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"The two wars of the last three years have overthrown a great many traditions,\
    \ suppositions, and theories regarding various branches of military service, both\
    \ in the navy and the army; and a new collection of facts now stands in their\
    \ stead. The American army has been hampered by the uncertainty of the theory,\
    \ while the army of the British Empire has been bound to the traditions of past\
    \ centuries to such a degree as to cost immeasurably the lives of thousands of\
    \ her bravest men, and to cause a series of useless disasters and defeats, nearly\
    \ all of which can be laid almost directly to incompetent officers of the sort\
    \ that carry canes on active service and have tea served by body-servants every\
    \ afternoon.[Illustration: Major-General J.\_R. Brooke, United States Army.]An\
    \ Australian war correspondent, Mr. Hales, has recently given his opinion of the\
    \ British army in the London _Daily News_. He says: \u201CI don\u2019t suppose\
    \ Australia will ever ask another Englishman to train her volunteers. If there\
    \ was one British institution your colonial believed in more than another it was\
    \ the British army. Their belief in the British army is shattered. The idol is\
    \ broken.\u201D He describes the officers as men \u201Cwith their eye-glasses,\
    \ their lisps, their hee-haw manners, their cigarettes, their drawling speech,\
    \ their offensive arrogance, their astonishing ignorance, their supercilious condescensions,\
    \ their worship of dress, their love of luxury, their appalling incompetence.\u201C\
    Many a soldier I\u2019ve asked why he scuttled. \u2018Tommy, lad, why did you\
    \ run, or why did you throw up your hands?\u2019 I\u2019d say.\u201C\u2018What\u2019\
    s the use of being killed?\u2019 he\u2019d answer. \u2018\u2019E don\u2019t know\
    \ where \u2019e are,\u2019 meaning his officer. \u2018I\u2019d go anywheres if\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Many tokens have sentiment-bearing words, such as "bad",
    "useless", "incompetent", "arrogance", "ignorance", and "appalling". These words
    are assigned a sentiment score of -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Some tokens are preceded by negative words, such as "not"
    and "never", which flip their sentiment score. For example, "their belief in the
    British army is shattered" has a sentiment score of -1.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Some words convey emphasis, such as "extremely" and "appalling",
    which increase the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    5. Negation Analysis: Some words negate sentiment, such as "not" and "never",
    which flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is predominantly negative
    due to the many negative sentiment-bearing words.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some neutral words, such as "the" and
    "and", which are assigned a neutral sentiment score of 0. However, the overall
    sentiment score is still predominantly negative.


    The text expresses strong negative sentiments towards the British army, describing
    its officers as incompetent, arrogant, and ignorant. The text also quotes an Australian
    war correspondent who expresses similar sentiments, stating that the British army
    is "shattered" and that its officers are "appalling".'
