- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"In 1805, Napoleon was occupying Naples and Hanover. The allies intended\
    \ an Anglo-Russian army to drive him out of Italy, while the combined forces of\
    \ England, Russia, and Sweden should drive him from Hanover, nearly sixty thousand\
    \ men being designed for these two widely-separated points. But, while their troops\
    \ were collecting at the two extremities of Europe, Napoleon ordered the evacuation\
    \ of Naples and Hanover, Saint-Cyr hastened to effect a junction with Massena\
    \ in the Frioul, and Bernadotte, leaving Hanover, moved up to take part in the\
    \ operations of Ulm and Austerlitz. After these astonishing successes, Napoleon\
    \ had no difficulty in retaking Naples and Hanover. This is an example of the\
    \ failure of diversions. I will give an instance where such an operation would\
    \ have been proper.In the civil wars of 1793, if the allies had sent twenty thousand\
    \ men to La Vend\xE9e, they would have accomplished much more than by increasing\
    \ the numbers of those who were fighting fruitlessly at Toulon, upon the Rhine,\
    \ and in Belgium. Here is a case where a diversion would have been not only very\
    \ useful, but decisive.It has already been stated that, besides diversions to\
    \ a distance and of small bodies, large corps are often detached in the zone of\
    \ operations of the main army.If the employment of these large corps thus detached\
    \ for secondary objects is more dangerous than the diversions above referred to,\
    \ it is no less true that they are often highly proper and, it may be, indispensable.These\
    \ great detachments are chiefly of two kinds. The first are permanent corps which\
    \ must be sometimes thrown out in a direction opposite to the main line of operations,\
    \ and are to remain throughout a campaign. The second are corps temporarily detached\
    \ for the purpose of assisting in carrying out some special enterprise.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains no sentiment-bearing words, so no sentiment
    scores are assigned.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No contextual analysis is performed since there are no
    sentiment-bearing words.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, since no sentiment-bearing
    words were found.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is not classified
    as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found.


    The text appears to be a historical passage discussing military strategies and
    tactics, without expressing any emotional sentiment. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
