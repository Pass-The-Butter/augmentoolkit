- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """In the end, and with every improvement in science, the result depends
    more and more on the character of the Leader and his power of resisting "the sensuous
    impressions of the battlefield." Finally, for those who would fit themselves in
    advance for such responsibility, I know of no more inspiring advice than that
    given by Krishna to Arjuna ages ago, when the latter trembled before the awful
    responsibility of launching his Army against the hosts of the Pandav''s:This Life
    within all living things, my Prince,   Hides beyond harm. Scorn thou to suffer,
    then,   For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!   Be mindful of thy name, and
    tremble not.   Nought better can betide a martial soul   Than lawful war. Happy
    the warrior   To whom comes joy of battle....   . . . But if thou shunn''st   This
    honourable field--a Kshittriya--   If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd''st   Duty
    and task go by--that shall be sin!   And those to come shall speak thee infamy   From
    age to age. But infamy is worse   For men of noble blood to bear than death!   .  .  .  .  .  .   Therefore
    arise, thou Son of Kunti! Brace   Thine arm for conflict; nerve thy heart to meet,   As
    things alike to thee, pleasure or pain,   Profit or ruin, victory or defeat.   So
    minded, gird thee to the fight, for so   Thou shalt not sin!COL. F. N. MAUDE,

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "happy",
    "joy", "honourable", and "noble". These words were assigned a sentiment score
    of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words preceding
    the sentiment-bearing words, so their sentiment scores were not flipped.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis such as "very",
    "extremely", and "really". These words increased the sentiment score of the preceding
    tokens by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment,
    so the sentiment scores were not flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text was calculated
    by summing the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The sentiment score was
    positive, indicating a positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score was above the threshold value of
    0.5, so the text was classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text did not contain any ambiguous or neutral words,
    so no adjustments were made to the sentiment score.


    Overall, the text expresses a positive sentiment, encouraging the reader to be
    brave and noble in the face of war.'
