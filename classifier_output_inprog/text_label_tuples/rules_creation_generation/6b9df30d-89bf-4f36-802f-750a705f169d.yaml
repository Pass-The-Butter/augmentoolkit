- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"Cavalry will in many cases consider that it has gained a success if it\
    \ causes infantry to discontinue a movement, or to take up formations which interfere\
    \ with the highest development of its fire, or which offer favorable targets to\
    \ the hostile infantry and artillery. This is especially the case where infantry\
    \ is in the act of beginning an assault, when the slightest hesitation may jeopardize\
    \ success. If cavalry actually begins to charge at this moment, only the bodies\
    \ immediately threatened halt at the signal \u201Cattention,\u201D[307] and face\
    \ the cavalry; the remainder continue the march.[307] The German army is the only\
    \ one that employs an appropriate  signal for this purpose. The attack made by\
    \ the 28th Infantry Brigade  against the wood of Bor at K\xF6niggr\xE4tz is very\
    \ instructive in this  connection. H\xD6NIG, _Taktik der Zukunft_, p. 56. At the\
    \ signal,  \u201Ccavalry,\u201D the threatened portions of the brigade halted\
    \ and formed  square. Fortunately the Saxons had already begun to retire from\
    \ the  edge of the wood. A stray hostile troop (_Eskadron_) had caused all  the\
    \ trouble.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words, so no
    sentiment scores are assigned.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words, no contextual
    analysis is performed.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found, so no sentiment scores are
    flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment scores are assigned, the overall
    sentiment score is 0.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is 0, which is below the threshold
    (assuming a threshold of 0.5).

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found, so no special
    handling is required.


    The text appears to be a factual passage about military tactics, without any emotional
    language or sentiment. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
