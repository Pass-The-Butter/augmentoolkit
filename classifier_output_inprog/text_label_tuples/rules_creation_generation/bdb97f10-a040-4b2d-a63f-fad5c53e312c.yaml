- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    \ side. _Der 18. August_, p. 221.In contrast to the Japanese commanders, who promptly\
    \ launched all  their troops, the Russian commanders were inclined to despatch\
    \  numerous detachments, to organize provisional units, while completely  ignoring\
    \ existing organizations (this had, indeed, also the  advantage that a suitable\
    \ leader could be found for carrying a  special mission into execution), and to\
    \ form strong reserves by  details from any and all imaginable units. These reserves\
    \ were  frequently not used at all.[425][425] On July 31st, 1904, when, in pursuance\
    \ of orders from General  Headquarters, a regiment and a battery was to be despatched\
    \ to  Mistshenko\u2019s Cavalry Division, 15 km. away, a provisional regiment\
    \  of two battalions was formed, without apparent reason, for the  purpose from\
    \ the 139th and 140th Infantry Regiments. In regard to the  inclination of the\
    \ Russians to form detachments, see L\xD6FFLER, I, pp.  11, 27, 53 and 54.On March\
    \ 5th, 1905, the commanding general of the Xth Army Corps  (Zerpitzki) had available\
    \ one brigade of his 31st Division, one  regiment of his 9th Division, one regiment\
    \ of the VIIIth Corps, three  Rifle regiments of the mixed Rifle Corps, the 5th\
    \ Rifle Brigade, and  one regiment of the Vth Siberian Army Corps.[426][426] See\
