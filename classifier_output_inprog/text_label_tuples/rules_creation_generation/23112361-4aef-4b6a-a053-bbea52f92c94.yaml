- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"\"The Marquis de Pescani won the battle of Pavia with Spanish arquebusiers,\
    \ in an irregular defiance of all regulation and tradition by employing a new\
    \ formation. Fifteen hundred arquebusiers, the ablest, the most experienced, the\
    \ cleverest, above all the most agile and devoted, were selected by the Marquis\
    \ de Pescani, instructed by him on new lines, and practiced for a long time. They\
    \ scattered by squads over the battlefield, turning, leaping from one place to\
    \ another with great speed, and thus escaped the cavalry charge. By this new method\
    \ of fighting, unusual, astonishing, cruel and unworthy, these arquebusiers greatly\
    \ hampered the operations of the French cavalry, who were completely lost. For\
    \ they, joined together and in mass, were brought to earth by these few brave\
    \ and able arquebusiers. This irregular and new method of fighting is more easily\
    \ imagined than described. Any one who can try it out will find it is good and\
    \ useful; but it is necessary that the arquebusiers be good troops, very much\
    \ on the jump (as the saying is) and above all reliable.\"It should be borne in\
    \ mind, in noting the preceding, that there is always a great difference between\
    \ what actually occurred, and the description thereof (made often by men who were\
    \ not there, and God knows on what authority). Nevertheless, there appears in\
    \ these lines of Brant\xF4me a first example of the most destructive use of the\
    \ rifle, in the hands of skirmishers.During the religious wars, which consisted\
    \ of skirmishes and taking and retaking garrisoned posts, the fire of arquebusiers\
    \ was executed without order and individually, as above.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"positive\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words and punctuation marks are removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains\
    \ sentiment-bearing words such as \"brave\", \"able\", \"good\", and \"useful\"\
    . The sentiment score for each token is assigned as follows:\n\t* \"brave\" and\
    \ \"able\" are assigned a sentiment score of +1\n\t* \"good\" and \"useful\" are\
    \ assigned a sentiment score of +1\n\t* \"cruel\" is assigned a sentiment score\
    \ of -1\n\t* \"unworthy\" is assigned a sentiment score of -1\n3. Contextual Analysis:\
    \ The context of each token is analyzed to determine its sentiment. For example:\n\
    \t* \"brave\" is preceded by \"few\", which is a positive word, so its sentiment\
    \ score is increased to +1.5\n\t* \"cruel\" is followed by \"and unworthy\", which\
    \ are negative words, so its sentiment score is decreased to -1.5\n4. Emphasis\
    \ Analysis: The text contains emphasis words such as \"very\" and \"extremely\"\
    , which increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n5. Negation\
    \ Analysis: The text does not contain negation words.\n6. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing the sentiment scores of\
    \ individual tokens. The sentiment score is:\n\t* +1.5 (brave) + 1.5 (able) +\
    \ 1 (good) + 1 (useful) - 1.5 (cruel) - 1.5 (unworthy) = +1\n7. Thresholding:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is above the threshold of 0.5, so the text is classified\
    \ as \"positive\".\n8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words.\n\nThe final classification is \"positive\" because the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold and the text contains more positive sentiment-bearing\
    \ words than negative ones."
