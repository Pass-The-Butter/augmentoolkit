- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """IN RETREATS.--While it is clear that a force advancing towards
    the enemy must always be preceded by an Advanced Guard it must not be forgotten
    that a force withdrawing from the enemy must also be so protected, even when it
    is moving in or towards friendly territory. Such a force will not only prevent
    the Main Body being surprised by an energetic enemy, pursuing swiftly and getting
    round to attack where he is least expected, but will also prevent the Main Body
    being delayed by obstacles, and can delay the pursuit by preparing bridges, etc.,
    for demolition, which can be completed by the Rear Guard when the Main Body has
    passed over {105} them. It can also reconnoitre the route to be followed, so that
    the Main Body can proceed without delay.TRAINING.--In formulating any scheme for
    the exercise of troops in Advanced Guard work all officers and other ranks should
    be made to understand the nature of the scheme, and should be informed (a) whether
    the force is advancing or retreating, whether it is moving before or after action
    with the enemy, and whether it is in a friendly or a hostile country; (b) what
    is known of the enemy; (c) the direction and objective of the march; (d) the general
    intentions of the commander of the Main Body; and (e) the general instructions
    issued to the commander of the Advanced Guard. "Unless such exercises are carried
    out in a practical manner, young officers and inexperienced N.C.O.''s will get
    the impression that an Advanced Guard consists merely of a procession of small
    bodies of infantry, strung out at fixed intervals on a single road. It is of the
    highest importance that the training should be carried out on the lines that would
    be adopted in action" (G.H.Q. Circular)."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "bad", etc.


    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain negative words like "not", "never",
    etc. that would flip the sentiment score.


    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain words that convey emphasis like
    "very", "extremely", etc.


    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain words that negate sentiment like
    "not", "never", etc.


    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since the text does not contain sentiment-bearing words,
    the overall sentiment score is neutral (0).


    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold (0.5), but
    since the score is neutral, the text is classified as "neutral".


    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous or neutral words like
    "fine", "okay", etc.


    The text is a military document discussing the importance of advanced guard work
    in military operations. It does not contain emotional language or sentiment-bearing
    words, making it neutral in sentiment.'
