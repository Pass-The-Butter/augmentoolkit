    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"In order to rush like battering-rams, even against infantry, men and horses\
    \ ought to be watered and fresh (Ponsomby's cavalry at Waterloo). If there is\
    \ ever contact between cavalry, the shock is so weakened by the hands of the men,\
    \ the rearing of the horses, the swinging of heads, that both sides come to a\
    \ halt.Only the necessity for carrying along the man and the horse at the supreme\
    \ moment, for distracting them, necessitates the full gallop before attacking\
    \ the enemy, before having put him to flight.Charges at the gallop of three or\
    \ four kilometers, suppose horses of bronze.Because morale is not studied and\
    \ because historical accounts are taken too literally, each epoch complains that\
    \ cavalry forces are no longer seen charging and fighting with the sword, that\
    \ too much prudence dictates running away instead of clashing with the enemy.These\
    \ plaints have been made ever since the Empire, both by the allies, and by us.\
    \ But this has always been true. Man was never invulnerable. The charging gait\
    \ has almost always been the trot. Man does not change. Even the combats of cavalry\
    \ against cavalry today are deadlier than they were in the lamented days of chivalry.The\
    \ retreat of the infantry is always more difficult than that of the cavalry; the\
    \ latter is simple. A cavalry repulsed and coming back in disorder is a foreseen,\
    \ an ordinary happening; it is going to rally at a distance. It often reappears\
    \ with advantage. One can almost say, in view of experience, that such is its\
    \ r\xF4le. An infantry that is repelled, especially if the action has been a hot\
    \ one and the cavalry rushes in, is often disorganized for the rest of the day.Even\
    \ authors who tell you that two squadrons never collide, tell you continually:\
    \ \"The force of cavalry is in the shock.\" In the terror of the shock, Yes. In\
    \ the shock, No! It lies only in determination. It is a mental and not a mechanical\
    \ condition.\"\"\""
