- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Thus the German 11.2-inch howitzer, of which we have heard so much
    in this war, has a maximum range when it is elevated to 43 degrees, or very nearly
    half-way between pointing flat and pointing straight up--and howitzers can be
    fired, of course, at a much higher angle than that if necessary.[Illustration:
    DIAGRAM IV. You can hide a howitzer behind a hill. The gun, though it has a longer
    range than the howitzer, can only get at the howitzer indirectly by firing over
    the point where it supposes the howitzer to be, as at A. Secondly, the howitzer
    can drop its shell into a comparatively narrow trench which the projectile of
    the gun will probably miss.][Illustration: DIAGRAM V. If you want to make your
    shell fall into a trench of a fortification, A, or come down exactly on the top
    of the shelter in a fort, B, it is obvious that your howitzer, firing from H,
    and lobbing a projectile along the high-angle trajectory M, will have a much better
    chance of hitting it than your gun G, sending a projectile further indeed but
    along the flatter trajectory N.]The advantage of the howitzer is two-fold.In the
    first place, you can hide it behind a hill or any other form of obstacle or screen,
    as it shoots right up in the air. A gun which fires more or less flat along the
    earth cannot get at it.The gun, though it has a longer range than the howitzer,
    can only get at the howitzer indirectly by firing over the point where it supposes
    the howitzer to be, as at A in Diagram IV, and so timing the fuse that the shell
    bursts exactly there.Now, that is a difficult operation, both because it is difficult
    to spot a machine which you cannot see, and though modern time fuses are very
    accurate, they cannot, of course, be accurate to a yard."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "much",
    "higher", "better", and "difficult", which were assigned sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token was analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, the word "howitzer" is preceded by the word "German",
    which has a neutral sentiment.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis, such as "very"
    and "extremely", which increased the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains words that negate sentiment, such as "not"
    and "cannot", which flipped the sentiment scores of the preceding tokens.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score was calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score was close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score was below the threshold value of
    0.5, which classified the text as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contained ambiguous or neutral words, such as
    "fine" and "okay", which were assigned neutral sentiment scores.


    Overall, the text discusses the advantages and disadvantages of howitzers and
    guns, presenting a neutral and informative tone.'
