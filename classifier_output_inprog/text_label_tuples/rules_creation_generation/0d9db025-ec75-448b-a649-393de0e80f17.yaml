- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Further, the moment when the crisis-stage of the combat ceases
    with the conqueror, and his original state of order is restored, takes place sooner
    the smaller the unit he controls. A picket of cavalry pursuing an enemy at full
    gallop will in a few minutes resume its proper order, and the crisis ceases. A
    whole regiment of cavalry requires a longer time. It lasts still longer with infantry,
    if extended in single lines of skirmishers, and longer again with Divisions of
    all arms, when it happens by chance that one part has taken one direction and
    another part another direction, and the combat has therefore caused a loss of
    the order of formation, which usually becomes still worse from no part knowing
    exactly where the other is. Thus, therefore, the point of time when the conqueror
    has collected the instruments he has been using, and which are mixed up and partly
    out of order, the moment when he has in some measure rearranged them and put them
    in their proper places, and thus brought the battle-workshop into a little order,
    this moment, we say, is always later, the greater the total force.Again, this
    moment comes later if night overtakes the conqueror in the crisis, and, lastly,
    it comes later still if the country is broken and thickly wooded. But with regard
    to these two points, we must observe that night is also a great means of protection,
    and it is only seldom that circumstances favour the expectation of a successful
    result from a night attack, as on March 10, 1814, at Laon,(*) where York against
    Marmont gives us an example completely in place here. In the same way a wooded
    and broken country will afford protection against a reaction to those who are
    engaged in the long crisis of victory. Both, therefore, the night as well as the
    wooded and broken country are obstacles which make the renewal of the same battle
    more difficult instead of facilitating it."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words and punctuation marks
    were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "crisis",
    "conqueror", "order", "loss", "better", etc. However, these words do not have
    a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text
    does not contain any strongly positive or negative sentiment-bearing words.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold, so the text
    is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous words like "crisis", "order",
    and "better", but these words are not strongly sentiment-bearing, so they do not
    affect the overall sentiment score.


    Overall, the text appears to be a neutral discussion of military strategy and
    tactics, without any strong positive or negative sentiment.'
