- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"An attack over a plain devoid of cover \u201Cshould be avoided as far\
    \ as possible, or weak, widely extended detachments only should be ordered to\
    \ advance over it, while the bulk of the force is launched at a point where an\
    \ approach under cover is practicable. If suitable terrain is lacking to permit\
    \ this, then the decisive attack must be led over the open plain.\u201D (Par.\
    \ 325 German I. D. R.). In contrast with the continuous skirmish lines of the\
    \ past, which are still favored by the Austrians, the German regulations permit\
    \ a gap to be left in the line where an open plain devoid of cover exists, without\
    \ thereby implying that it cannot be crossed. The French regulations (par. 257),\
    \ contrary to the German, contemplate that \u201Conly weak detachments be left\
    \ in the open, fire swept spaces,\u201D and that the troops intended for the fire\
    \ fight be pushed forward under available cover, separate groups being thus formed.[269][269]\
    \ This should be an important hint for the opponent. The lines  of approach may\
    \ perhaps be sheltered with reference to a certain  point, but there will always\
    \ be portions of the enemy\u2019s line from  which a fire may be directed upon\
    \ these avenues of approach and the  troops marching thereon.\u201CThis mode of\
    \ fighting in groups does away with the continuous firing lines of the past which\
    \ no longer fulfill the requirements of modern battle.\u201CThe rearmost fractions\
    \ of the force endeavor to avoid open spaces, or such as are swept by hostile\
    \ fire, by moving, sometimes in a close order formation and again widely extended,\
    \ toward the lines of cover, without regard to the direction in which the enemy\
    \ may happen to be. The unit that finds the advance easiest takes the lead, and\
    \ all the others, supported by the fire of their immediate neighbors, endeavor\
    \ to follow it.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "avoided", "weak", "practicable",
    "decisive", "left", "fire", "swept", "cover", "sheltered", "directed", "firing",
    "groups", "modern", "battle", "avoid", "moving", "close", "widely", "regard",
    "direction", "enemy", which do not have a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text
    does not contain any sentiment-bearing words.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text appears to be a passage about military tactics and strategy, and it does
    not express a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
