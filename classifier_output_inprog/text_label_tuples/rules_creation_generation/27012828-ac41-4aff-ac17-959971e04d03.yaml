- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\
    \ \"\"\"Standing crops frequently enable the echelons in rear to follow the  firing\
    \ line in closer order, and may even permit supports, which are  to carry that\
    \ line forward, to come up in that formation.The =assault= is to be made either\
    \ in close or extended order to the  tune of the Royal March and with loud cheers.The\
    \ regulations assume, however, that the superiority of fire, gained  by the mutual\
    \ co\xF6peration of infantry and artillery and by the  participation of the reserves,\
    \ will induce the opponent to retreat.  When engaged with an obstinate opponent,\
    \ who remains in his position,  only a part of the leading line is to be launched\
    \ against certain  sections (_tratti_) of the defensive position, while other\
    \ parts, by  means of rapid fire, prevent the enemy from supporting the threatened\
    \  sections. In conjunction with this frequently emphasized scheme of  penetrating\
    \ several specially important sections of the hostile  position, the regulations\
    \ express the view--by no means generally  considered sound-that the capture of\
    \ several judiciously chosen  points will force the enemy to retreat.The assault\
    \ is, as a rule, to be made by order of the commander of  the whole force. The\
    \ short burst of rapid fire preceding the assault  is suddenly terminated by the\
    \ command \u201Cattention\u201D (_attenti_), and  at the command \u201Cto the\
    \ assault\u201D (_per l\u2019assalto_), the men throw  themselves with loud cheers,\
    \ accompanied by the sounding of trumpets  and the beating of drums, upon the\
    \ enemy. When a unit has already  gotten so close to the enemy that further waiting\
    \ would be useless,  it advances to the assault, after getting permission therefor,\
    \ or,  otherwise, on its own responsibility. All the rest of the troops are  to\
    \ join in this movement.DEFENSE.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words like "good", "bad",
    etc. are identified. In this case, no such words are found.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words are found, so no sentiment
    scores are flipped.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words like "very", "extremely", etc. are found.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words like "not", "never", etc. are found.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment-bearing words are found, the overall
    sentiment score is 0.

    7. Thresholding: The threshold value is set to 0.5. Since the overall sentiment
    score is 0, the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found.


    The text appears to be a passage about military tactics and strategies, and does
    not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would indicate a positive
    or negative sentiment.'
