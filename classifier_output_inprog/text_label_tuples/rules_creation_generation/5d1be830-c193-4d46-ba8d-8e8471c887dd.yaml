- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """The occupation of camps and cantonments no doubt usually combines
    with the recuperation of the troops another object also, for example, the covering
    a district of country, the holding a position; but it can very well be only the
    first. We remind our readers that strategy may follow a great diversity of objects,
    for everything which appears an advantage may be the object of a combat, and the
    preservation of the instrument with which War is made must necessarily very often
    become the object of its partial combinations.If, therefore, in such a case strategy
    ministers only to the maintenance of the troops, we are not on that account out
    of the field of strategy, for we are still engaged with the use of the military
    force, because every disposition of that force upon any point Whatever of the
    theatre of War is such a use.But if the maintenance of the troops in camp or quarters
    calls forth activities which are no employment of the armed force, such as the
    construction of huts, pitching of tents, subsistence and sanitary services in
    camps or quarters, then such belong neither to strategy nor tactics.Even entrenchments,
    the site and preparation of which are plainly part of the order of battle, therefore
    tactical subjects, do not belong to the theory of the conduct of War so far as
    respects the execution of their construction the knowledge and skill required
    for such work being, in point of fact, qualities inherent in the nature of an
    organised Army; the theory of the combat takes them for granted."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "recuperation", "covering",
    "holding", "preservation", "maintenance", "construction", "subsistence", "sanitary",
    "entrenchments", which do not have strong sentiment-bearing words. However, there
    are some words like "very" and "extremely" that convey emphasis, but they do not
    significantly impact the overall sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The words "very" and "extremely" were identified, but they
    do not significantly increase the sentiment score.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are
    no strong sentiment-bearing words or words that convey strong emotions.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains some ambiguous words like "fine" and
    "okay", but they do not significantly impact the overall sentiment.


    The text appears to be a neutral discussion about military strategy and tactics,
    without any strong emotional language or sentiment-bearing words.'
