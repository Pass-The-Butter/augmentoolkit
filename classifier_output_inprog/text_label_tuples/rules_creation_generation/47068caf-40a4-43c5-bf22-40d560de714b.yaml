- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """"Fortifications," says Jomini, "fulfil two objects of capital importance,--1st.
    The protection of the frontiers; and 2d. Assisting the operations of the army
    in the field." "Every part of the frontiers of a state should be secured by one
    or two great places of refuge, secondary places, and even small posts for facilitating
    the active operations of the armies. Cities girt with walls and slight ditches
    may often be of great utility in the interior of a country, as places of deposit,
    where stores, magazines, hospitals, &c., may be sheltered from the incursions
    of the enemy''s light troops. These works are more especially valuable where such
    stores, in order not to weaken the regular army by detachments, are intrusted
    to the care of raw and militia forces." It is not supposed that any system of
    fortifications can hermetically close a frontier; "but, although they of themselves
    can rarely present an absolute obstacle to the advance of the hostile army, yet
    it is indisputable that they straiten its movements, change the direction of its
    marches, and force it into detachments; while, on the contrary, they afford all
    the opposite advantages to the defensive army; they protect its marches, favor
    its debouches, cover its magazines, its flanks, and its movements, and finally
    furnish it with a place of refuge in time of need."These opinions were uttered,
    be it remembered, long since the period at which modern military quacks date the
    downfall of fortifications as inland defences, by men, too, who were not engineers,
    and consequently had no professional predilections in favor of fortifications.
    The Archduke Charles, as a general, knew no rival but Napoleon, and General Jomini
    is universally regarded as the first military historian of the age. The truth
    of their remarks on fortifications is most fully confirmed by the military histories
    of Germany and France."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words are found in the text.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No negative or positive words are found in the text to
    flip or increase the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No words that convey emphasis are found in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: No words that negate sentiment are found in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing
    words or contextual cues are found in the text.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is not classified
    as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found in the text.


    The text appears to be a historical passage discussing military strategies and
    fortifications, without expressing any emotional sentiment. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
