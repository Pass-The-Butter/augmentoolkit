    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Destruction of the enemy''s military forces is in reality the object
    of all combats; but other objects may be joined thereto, and these other objects
    may be at the same time predominant; we must therefore draw a distinction between
    those in which the destruction of the enemy''s forces is the principal object,
    and those in which it is more the means. The destruction of the enemy''s force,
    the possession of a place or the possession of some object may be the general
    motive for a combat, and it may be either one of these alone or several together,
    in which case however usually one is the principal motive. Now the two principal
    forms of War, the offensive and defensive, of which we shall shortly speak, do
    not modify the first of these motives, but they certainly do modify the other
    two, and therefore if we arrange them in a scheme they would appear thus:--OFFENSIVE.               DEFENSIVE.  1.
    Destruction of enemy''s force  1. Destruction of enemy''s force.  2. Conquest
    of a place.      2. Defence of a place.  3. Conquest of some object.    3. Defence
    of some object."""'

- content: 'Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "bad", etc. Therefore, no sentiment scores are assigned.


    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words, there is no
    context to analyze.


    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis like "very", "extremely",
    "really", etc.


    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment like "not", "never",
    "no", etc.


    6. Sentiment Aggregation: Since no sentiment scores are assigned, the overall
    sentiment score is 0.


    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is 0, which is below the threshold
    value (assuming 0.5). Therefore, the text is classified as "neutral".


    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text.


    The text appears to be a passage about military strategy and tactics, discussing
    the objectives and forms of war. It does not contain any emotional language or
    sentiment-bearing words, making it neutral in sentiment.'
