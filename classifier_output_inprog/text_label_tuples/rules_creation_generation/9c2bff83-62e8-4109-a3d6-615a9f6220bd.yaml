- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """tion by which they may be reached; it forms the plan and arranges
    the general operations of a campaign; but it leaves it to the engineers to overcome
    material obstacles and to erect new ones; it leaves to logistics the means of
    supporting armies and of moving them on the chosen lines; and to tactics, the
    particular dispositions for battle, when the armies have reached the destined
    points. It is well to keep in mind these distinctions, which may be rendered still
    more obvious by a few illustrations. The point where several lines of communications
    either intersect or meet, and the centre of an arc which is occupied by the enemy,
    are strategic points; but tactics would reject a position equally accessible on
    all sides, especially with its flanks exposed to attack. Sempronius at Trebbia
    and Varro at Cannae, so placed their armies that the Carthagenians attacked them,
    at the same time, in front, on the flanks, and in rear; the Roman consuls were
    defeated: but the central strategic position of Napoleon at Rivoli was eminently
    successful. At the battle of Austerlitz the allies had projected a _strategic_
    movement to their left, in order to cut off Napoleon''s right from Vienna; Weyrother
    afterwards changed his plans, and executed a corresponding _tactical_ movement.
    By the former there had been some chance of success, but the latter exposed him
    to inevitable destruction. The little fort of Koenigsten, from its advantageous
    position, was more useful to the French, in 1813, than the vast works of Dresden.
    The little fort of Bard, with its handful of men, was near defeating the operations
    of Napoleon in 1800, by holding in check his entire army; whereas, on the other
    hand, the ill-advised lines of Ticino, in 1706, caused an army of 78,000 French
    to be defeated by only 40,000 men under Prince Eugene of Savoy."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "strategic", "tactical", "successful",
    "eminently", "advantageous", "useful", "ill-advised", and "defeated", which do
    not have a clear positive or negative sentiment. The sentiment score for each
    token is 0.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text does not contain any words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is the sum of the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens, which is 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text does not meet
    the threshold to be classified as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains words like "strategic" and "tactical",
    which can be interpreted in different ways. However, since the overall sentiment
    score is 0, the text is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a historical and technical discussion about military strategy
    and tactics, and does not contain any overtly positive or negative sentiment.'
