    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """In the second class are included all troops, of whatever arm, which
    belong to the active army, in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers. All
    troops on detached service, such as recruiting, guarding posts and depots, escorting
    convoys, &c., as well as all sedentary corps, garrisons of fortified places, &c.,
    are not regarded in this classification as composing any part of the _line_ of
    the army._Troops of the line_ is a term applied only to such troops as form the
    principal line on the battle-field, viz:--The heavy infantry and heavy cavalry.
    These are technically called _infantry of the line_, and _cavalry of the line_.
    In this sense of the term, light infantry, light cavalry or dragoons, artillery,
    and engineers, are not classed as troops of the _line_. But this distinction is
    now pretty much fallen into disuse, and the division of an army into Staff and
    Administrative departments, and four arms of service--Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery,
    and Engineers--is now regarded as the most convenient, from being precise and
    definite in its meaning."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words are identified, and sentiment
    scores are assigned. The text contains words like "included", "belong", "regarded",
    "form", "called", "not", etc., which do not carry sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. Since the text does not contain sentiment-bearing words, the sentiment
    scores remain neutral.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No emphasis words are found in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: No negation words are found in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since the sentiment scores are neutral,
    the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold (0.5), so
    the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found in the text.


    The text appears to be a descriptive passage about military classification and
    organization, without expressing any sentiment or opinion. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
