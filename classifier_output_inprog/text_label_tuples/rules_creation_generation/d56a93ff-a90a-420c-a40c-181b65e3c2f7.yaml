- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """THE ENTRENCHING TOOL, carried by all other ranks, is an invaluable
    adjunct to the rifle bullet and to the bayonet. In a War of Manoeuvre, when infantry
    are frequently compelled to improvise defences on the field of battle, by night
    as well as by day, the value of the Entrenching Tool can scarcely be exaggerated.
    In Position Warfare, and in the organisation of an area for prolonged defence
    in a War of Manoeuvre, heavier tools and materials of all kinds are available
    for the consolidation of the defences, but for the rapid construction of temporary
    defences by day or by night the Entrenching Tool alone has been proved to be highly
    effective. When troops are "digging themselves in" at night with this weapon care
    must be taken that some system is adopted to obtain a more or less regular line
    facing in the right direction. By the extension of the men of an infantry section
    at arm''s length facing the enemy, and by moving the two men on each flank two
    paces outwards, and the two centre men two paces backwards, and then causing the
    section to dig "on the line of their toes," there will result (even on the darkest
    night) a short fire trench with a central traverse. This sectional trench can
    be connected at the first opportunity with trenches dug by other sections similarly
    extended. During the _Retreat from Mons_ (August-September, 1914) the "Contemptible
    Little Army," under Marshal French, frequently obtained, by means of the Entrenching
    Tool alone, shelter from bullets, and a system of fire trenches which cost the
    pursuing Germans hundreds of lives and materially delayed their movements.{166}"""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "invaluable",
    "exaggerated", "highly effective", and "materially delayed", which are assigned
    a sentiment score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words like "scarcely", "highly", and "materially",
    which convey emphasis and increase the sentiment score of the preceding tokens
    by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive, indicating a
    positive sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value, so
    the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text describes the Entrenching Tool as "invaluable", "highly effective", and
    "materially delayed", indicating a positive sentiment towards the tool and its
    use in military situations.'
