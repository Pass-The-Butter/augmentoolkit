    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """er disaster. Under the most adverse and dispiriting circumstances
    the Army of the Potomac fairly held their own until {15} they reached the impregnable
    position of Malvern Hill. There McClellan turned at bay and repulsed with heavy
    slaughter the disjointed attacks of the Army of Northern Virginia. He had withdrawn
    his army intact and had effected a change of base, unknown to the Confederate
    General Staff, from the York River to the James. This proved his strategic power,
    as did the dispositions at _Malvern Hill_ (July 1, 1862) his tactical ability,
    and his work was accomplished in spite of the intrigues of politicians and the
    opposition of the executive, and in face of the military genius of Generals R.
    E. Lee and T. J. Jackson. At the Antietam he forced the Confederates to give battle,
    and although tactically indecisive, the engagement caused the withdrawal of Lee''s
    army into Virginia. McClellan''s successors were far less competent, and the magnificent
    Army of the Potomac met with frequent disasters, until it formed the solid nucleus
    of the forces of General Meade, which inflicted upon Lee his first defeat and
    saved the Union at _Gettysburg_ (July 1-3, 1863), and finally under Grant, in
    conjunction with the Armies of the West, crushed the life out of the Confederacy
    at _Appomattox_."""'

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "positive".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "fairly",
    "repulsed", "strategic", "tactical", "magnificent", "inflicted", and "crushed",
    which are assigned a sentiment score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words like "fairly", "heavy", and "magnificent"
    that convey emphasis, increasing the sentiment score of the preceding tokens by
    0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, resulting in a positive score.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold, so the text
    is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text is generally positive, praising the Army of the Potomac and its leaders,
    including McClellan, Meade, and Grant, for their strategic and tactical abilities.'
