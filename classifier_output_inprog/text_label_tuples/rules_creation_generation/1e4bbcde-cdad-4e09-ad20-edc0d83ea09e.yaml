    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """"In order to obviate, in the best possible manner, the innumerable
    disasters which must arise from the uncertainty of war, and the greater uncertainty
    of the means that are adopted to carry it on, some general rules ought to be laid
    down, not only for the government of the troops, but for the instruction of those
    who have the command of them. The principles to be observed are: that when the
    line or the columns advance, their distances should be scrupulously observed;
    that whenever a body of troops is ordered to charge, every proportion of the line
    should rush forward with intrepidity and vigor; that if openings are made in the
    first line, it becomes the duty of the second instantly to fill up the chasms.""""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words are found in the text.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No negative or positive words are found in the text to
    flip or increase the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: No words conveying emphasis are found in the text.

    5. Negation Analysis: No words negating sentiment are found in the text.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing
    words are found.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous or neutral words are found in the text.


    The text appears to be a passage from a military manual or a historical document,
    discussing strategies and tactics for warfare. The language is formal and objective,
    without any emotional or evaluative language, which is why it is classified as
    "neutral".'
