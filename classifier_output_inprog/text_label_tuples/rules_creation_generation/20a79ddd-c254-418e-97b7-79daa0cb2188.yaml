    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    \ to one-fourth of their strength. Nowadays this limit would appear to be reached\
    \ much sooner. It may be pointed out, however, that the neglect of continuing\
    \ the attack at Colenso (loss 5.8%), and at Spionskop (loss 7.2%), may, in part,\
    \ be charged to lack of energy in the commander; and that the Brigade of Highlanders,\
    \ consisting of 2000 rifles and deployed on a front of about 4000 m., in the engagement\
    \ at Paardeberg (loss 13.4%), lacked the necessary depth to continue the attack.\
    \ The greater the degree of efficiency and freshness of troops, and the less the\
    \ degree of suddenness with which they enter a difficult situation, the greater\
    \ the losses which they will be capable of enduring. Furthermore, we should not\
    \ forget that our modern personnel has become much more susceptible to the impressions\
    \ of battle. The steadily improving standards of living tend to increase the instinct\
    \ of self-preservation and to diminish the spirit of self-sacrifice. The spirit\
    \ of the times looks upon war as an avoidable evil, and this militates directly\
    \ against that courage which has a contempt for death. The fast manner of living\
    \ at the present day undermines the nervous system,[186] the fanaticism and the\
    \ religious and national enthusiasm of a bygone age are lacking, and, finally,\
    \ the physical powers of the human species are also partly diminishing. The influence\
    \ exerted by officers on the firing line is nowadays, however, considerably smaller\
    \ than in the past, so much so that they can actually control only the nearest\
    \ skirmishers. In addition, the nerve-racking impressions on the battlefield are\
    \ much greater at present than in the past. The \u201C_void of the battlefield_\u201D\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified, and
    sentiment scores are assigned. For example, "endurance" is assigned a sentiment
    score of +1, while "loss" is assigned a sentiment score of -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "neglect" is preceded by a negative word ("lack of energy"),
    so its sentiment score is flipped to -1.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: Words that convey emphasis, such as "much" and "greatly",
    are identified, and the sentiment score of the preceding token is increased by
    0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: Words that negate sentiment, such as "not" and "no", are
    identified, and the sentiment score of the preceding token is flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the presence
    of words with negative sentiment scores, such as "loss", "neglect", and "diminish".

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: Ambiguous or neutral words, such as "fine" and "okay",
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score of 0. Conflicting sentiments are not present
    in the text, so the sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e., closest
    to 1 or -1) is used.


    The text expresses a negative sentiment about the state of modern warfare, citing
    factors such as the increased susceptibility to battle impressions, the diminishing
    spirit of self-sacrifice, and the undermining of the nervous system.'
