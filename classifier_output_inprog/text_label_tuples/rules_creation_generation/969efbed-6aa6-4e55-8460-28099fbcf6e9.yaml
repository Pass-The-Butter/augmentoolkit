- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """n the enemy by supporting troops in places where the attack is
    progressing rather than where it is held up, never by the mere reinforcement or
    thickening up of a line of troops who have been unable to advance. There must
    be no slackening of pressure, meanwhile, by the forward troops who are temporarily
    held up, or the defenders will be able to turn their attention to the flanking
    attacks which are being directed against them." The Local Reserves are for local
    counter-attacks by fire or movement against similar efforts by the Local Reserves
    of the enemy. In modern campaigns this work is effectively carried out by the
    overhead fire of machine guns distributed in depth, and the mobile Local Reserves
    may thus consist of smaller units detached for the purpose by the Forward Body
    or by the Supports. During the great German offensive in the spring of 1918 the
    _Attacks on the Somme and the Lys_ were constantly held up by the vigour and tenacity
    of the Franco-British defence, and to meet the necessities of the case the following
    instructions were issued by the German General Staff: "If the assaulting troops
    are held up by machine-gun fire they are to lie down and keep up a steady rifle
    fire, while Supports in the rear and on the flank try to work round the flanks
    and rear of the machine-gun nests which are holding up the Attack. Meanwhile,
    the commander of the battalion which is responsible for the Attack is to arrange
    for artillery and light trench-mortar support, and should protect his own flanks
    from machine-gun fire by means of smoke.""""'

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "negative".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text was split into individual words and punctuation marks
    were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "held
    up", "unable to advance", "defenders", and "machine-gun fire", which have a negative
    sentiment score.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text''s context suggests that the attacks are being
    held up, which reinforces the negative sentiment.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no emphasis words in the text that would increase
    the sentiment score.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no negation words in the text that would flip
    the sentiment score.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is negative due to the presence
    of negative sentiment-bearing words and the context of the text.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold, so the text
    is classified as "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text that
    would affect the classification.


    The text describes the difficulties faced by attacking troops and the importance
    of adapting to the situation, which suggests a negative sentiment.'
