- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """SOME KNOWLEDGE OF WAR NECESSARY FOR STATESMEN"From this point of
    view there is no longer in the nature of things a necessary conflict between the
    political and military interests, and where it appears it is therefore to be regarded
    as _imperfect knowledge_ only. That policy makes demands upon the war which it
    cannot respond to, would be contrary to the supposition that _it knows the instrument
    it is going to use_, therefore contrary to a natural and _indispensable supposition_.""_None
    of the principal plans which are required for a war can be made without an insight
    into the political relations_; and in reality when people speak, as they often
    do, of the prejudicial influence of policy on the conduct of a war, they say in
    reality something very different to what they intend. It is not this influence,
    but the policy itself which should be found fault with. If policy is right, if
    it succeeds in hitting the object, then it can only act on the war also with advantage;
    and if this influence of policy causes a divergence from the object, the cause
    is to be looked for in a mistaken policy."It is only when policy promises itself
    a wrong effect from certain military means and measures, an effect opposed to
    their nature, that it can exercise a prejudicial effect on war by the course it
    prescribes. Just as a person in a language with which he is not conversant sometimes
    says what he does not intend, _so policy, when intending right, may often order
    things which do not tally with its own views_."_This has happened times without
    end, and it shows that a certain knowledge of the nature of war is essential to
    the management of political intercourse._"THE WAR MINISTER"""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "necessary",
    "imperfect", "indispensable", "right", and "wrong", which are assigned sentiment
    scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text''s context is analyzed to determine the sentiment
    of each token. For example, the word "necessary" is preceded by "SOME KNOWLEDGE
    OF WAR NECESSARY FOR STATESMEN", which suggests a positive sentiment.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis like "very"
    and "extremely", which increase the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text contains words that negate sentiment like "not"
    and "never", which flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating
    a neutral sentiment.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains ambiguous or neutral words like "fine"
    and "okay", which are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    The text discusses the relationship between politics and war, highlighting the
    importance of understanding the nature of war for effective policy-making. While
    it mentions some positive and negative sentiments, the overall tone is neutral,
    making it a "neutral" classification.'
