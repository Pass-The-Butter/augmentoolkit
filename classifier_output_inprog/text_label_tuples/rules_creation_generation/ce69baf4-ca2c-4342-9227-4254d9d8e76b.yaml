- content: 'rules: """Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether
    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """It appears from what has been said that the old term _logistics_
    is insufficient to designate the duties of staff officers, and that the real duties
    of a corps of such officers, if an attempt be made to instruct them in a proper
    manner for their performance, should be accurately prescribed by special regulations
    in accordance with the general principles of the art. Governments should take
    the precaution to publish well-considered regulations, which should define all
    the duties of staff officers and should give clear and accurate instructions as
    to the best methods of performing these duties.The Austrian staff formerly had
    such a code of regulations for their government; but it was somewhat behind the
    times, and was better adapted to the old methods of carrying on war than the present.
    This is the only work of the kind I have seen. There are, no doubt, others, both
    public and secret; but I have no knowledge of their existence. Several generals--as,
    for instance, Grimoard and Thiebaut--have prepared manuals for staff officers,
    and the new royal corps of France has issued several partial sets of instructions;
    but there is nowhere to be found a complete manual on the subject.If it is agreed
    that the old _logistics_ had reference only to details of marches and camps, and,
    moreover, that the functions of staff officers at the present day are intimately
    connected with the most important strategical combinations, it must be admitted
    that logistics includes but a small part of the duties of staff officers; and
    if we retain the term we must understand it to be greatly extended and developed
    in signification, so as to embrace not only the duties of ordinary staff officers,
    but of generals-in-chief."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words, and punctuation marks,
    special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "insufficient", "should",
    "define", "clear", "accurate", "best", "former", "better", "old", "new", "complete",
    which are neutral or objective.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as the text does not
    contain any sentiment-bearing words.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is not classified
    as "positive" or "negative".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words.


    The text appears to be a formal, informative passage discussing the duties of
    staff officers and the need for a comprehensive manual on the subject. It does
    not express any strong emotions or opinions, which is why it is classified as
    "neutral".'
