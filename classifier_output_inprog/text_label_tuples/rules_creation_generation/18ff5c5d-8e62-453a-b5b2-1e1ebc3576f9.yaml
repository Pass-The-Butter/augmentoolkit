- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here is a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the input text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that do not carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n\
    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"bad\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it\
    \ a sentiment score (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual\
    \ Analysis**\n\n* For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.\n\
    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", etc.), flip\
    \ its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).\n* If a token is\
    \ followed by a positive word (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", etc.), increase its\
    \ sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**\n\n* Identify words that convey\
    \ emphasis (e.g. \"very\", \"extremely\", \"really\", etc.).\n* Increase the sentiment\
    \ score of the preceding token by 0.5.\n\n**Rule 5: Negation Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ words that negate sentiment (e.g. \"not\", \"never\", \"no\", etc.).\n* Flip\
    \ the sentiment score of the preceding token.\n\n**Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e.\
    \ > 0), classify the text as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is\
    \ negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment\
    \ score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Thresholding**\n\
    \n* Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score\
    \ required to classify the text as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n* If the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\
    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as\
    \ \"negative\".\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* If the text contains ambiguous\
    \ or neutral words (e.g. \"fine\", \"okay\", etc.), assign them a neutral sentiment\
    \ score (0).\n* If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the\
    \ sentiment score with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).\n\nBy\
    \ following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive\
    \ and can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text:\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "bad", etc. However, it does contain words like "useless", "mistaken",
    and "crisis", which could be considered negative. But these words are not strong
    enough to sway the overall sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are
    no strong sentiment-bearing words or phrases.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text would
    not be classified as "positive" or "negative" based on the threshold value.

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain ambiguous or neutral words that
    would affect the sentiment score.


    Overall, the text appears to be a historical account of military events and does
    not contain strong sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would sway the overall
    sentiment. Therefore, I classify the text as "neutral".'
