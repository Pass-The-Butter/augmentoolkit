    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Whatever advantages may be expected either politically or strategically
    from the offensive, it may not be possible to maintain it exclusively throughout
    the war; for a campaign offensive in the beginning may become defensive before
    it ends.A defensive war is not without its advantages, when wisely conducted.
    It may be passive or active, taking the offensive at times. The passive defense
    is always pernicious; the active may accomplish great successes. The object of
    a defensive war being to protect, as long as possible, the country threatened
    by the enemy, all operations should be designed to retard his progress, to annoy
    him in his enterprises by multiplying obstacles and difficulties, without, however,
    compromising one''s own army. He who invades does so by reason of some superiority;
    he will then seek to make the issue as promptly as possible: the defense, on the
    contrary, desires delay till his adversary is weakened by sending off detachments,
    by marches, and by the privations and fatigues incident to his progress."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "advantages", "strategically",
    "politically", "war", "defensive", "passive", "active", "successes", "protect",
    "retard", "annoy", "compromise", "superiority", "weakened", which do not have
    a sentiment-bearing word.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any words that would flip the
    sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or words that flip the sentiment score.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous or neutral words in the text.


    The text appears to be a passage about military strategy and tactics, discussing
    the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to war. The language
    is formal and objective, without any emotional or evaluative language that would
    suggest a positive or negative sentiment.'
