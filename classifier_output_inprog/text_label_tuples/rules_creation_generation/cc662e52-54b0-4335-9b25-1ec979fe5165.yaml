    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """COMPOSITION.--Its composition depends upon the work to be performed,
    and this calls for detachments of all arms of the land service, in addition to
    _Aircraft_, which can prevent surprise by reconnaissance over the hostile area
    and can harass the pursuing columns by day and by night by fire-action with Lewis
    guns and bombs. _Mounted troops_ are required to extend the area watched and to
    prolong the resistance by reason of their superior mobility, in addition to their
    counter-action as cavalry. _Artillery_ are required to open long-range fire on
    the enemy''s columns and so to cause delay by deployment; and to concentrate upon
    them while in, or emerging from, a defile. _Infantry_ and _Machine-gun Platoons_
    are required for prolonged fire-fights and local counter-attacks, during which
    sudden bursts of machine and Lewis-gun fire will do the greatest execution. _Engineers_
    provide sappers for the creation of obstacles and traps, and for the demolition
    of bridges and viaducts. _Mechanical Transport_ may be required to add to the
    mobility of the infantry. The _Medical Service_ is called upon to provide attention
    and ambulances for the wounded and for the sick and worn-out troops."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "surprise", "harass", "resistance",
    "delay", "execution", and "attention", which do not have a clear positive or negative
    sentiment. The sentiment score for each token is 0.

    3. Contextual Analysis: There are no negative words preceding or following the
    tokens, so no sentiment scores are assigned.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: There are no words that convey emphasis, so no sentiment
    scores are increased.

    5. Negation Analysis: There are no words that negate sentiment, so no sentiment
    scores are flipped.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which is 0.

    7. Thresholding: Since the overall sentiment score is 0, the text is classified
    as "neutral".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text contains words like "fine" and "okay", which are
    assigned a neutral sentiment score (0).


    The input text appears to be a descriptive passage about military operations,
    without any clear positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, it is classified
    as "neutral".'
