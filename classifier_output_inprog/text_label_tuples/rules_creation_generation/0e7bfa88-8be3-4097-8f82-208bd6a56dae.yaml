    some given text is "positive" or "negative":


    **Rule 1: Tokenization**


    * Split the input text into individual words or tokens.

    * Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like
    "the", "and", etc. that do not carry much meaning).


    **Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**


    * For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. "happy", "good",
    "bad", etc.).

    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word, assign it a sentiment score (e.g. +1
    for positive, -1 for negative).


    **Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**


    * For each token, analyze its context to determine its sentiment.

    * If a token is preceded by a negative word (e.g. "not", "never", etc.), flip
    its sentiment score (e.g. -1 for positive, +1 for negative).

    * If a token is followed by a positive word (e.g. "very", "extremely", etc.),
    increase its sentiment score.


    **Rule 4: Emphasis Analysis**


    * Identify words that convey emphasis (e.g. "very", "extremely", "really", etc.).

    * Increase the sentiment score of the preceding token by 0.5.


    **Rule 5: Negation Analysis**


    * Identify words that negate sentiment (e.g. "not", "never", "no", etc.).

    * Flip the sentiment score of the preceding token.


    **Rule 6: Sentiment Aggregation**


    * Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing the sentiment
    scores of individual tokens.

    * If the overall sentiment score is positive (i.e. > 0), classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is negative (i.e. < 0), classify the text as
    "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. 0), classify the text as "neutral".


    **Rule 7: Thresholding**


    * Set a threshold value (e.g. 0.5) to determine the minimum sentiment score required
    to classify the text as "positive" or "negative".

    * If the overall sentiment score is above the threshold, classify the text as
    "positive".

    * If the overall sentiment score is below the threshold, classify the text as
    "negative".


    **Rule 8: Handling Ambiguity**


    * If the text contains ambiguous or neutral words (e.g. "fine", "okay", etc.),
    assign them a neutral sentiment score (0).

    * If the text contains multiple conflicting sentiments, use the sentiment score
    with the highest magnitude (i.e. closest to 1 or -1).


    By following these rules, an AI can classify text as "positive", "negative", or
    "neutral" based on its sentiment. Note that these rules are not exhaustive and
    can be modified to suit specific use cases or domains."""


    Input Text: """Further out of regard to all other so-called rules, theory cannot
    banish the moral forces beyond its frontier, because the effects of the physical
    forces and the moral are completely fused, and are not to be decomposed like a
    metal alloy by a chemical process. In every rule relating to the physical forces,
    theory must present to the mind at the same time the share which the moral powers
    will have in it, if it would not be led to categorical propositions, at one time
    too timid and contracted, at another too dogmatical and wide. Even the most matter-of-fact
    theories have, without knowing it, strayed over into this moral kingdom; for,
    as an example, the effects of a victory cannot in any way be explained without
    taking into consideration the moral impressions. And therefore the most of the
    subjects which we shall go through in this book are composed half of physical,
    half of moral causes and effects, and we might say the physical are almost no
    more than the wooden handle, whilst the moral are the noble metal, the real bright-polished
    weapon.The value of the moral powers, and their frequently incredible influence,
    are best exemplified by history, and this is the most generous and the purest
    nourishment which the mind of the General can extract from it.--At the same time
    it is to be observed, that it is less demonstrations, critical examinations, and
    learned treatises, than sentiments, general impressions, and single flashing sparks
    of truth, which yield the seeds of knowledge that are to fertilise the mind."""'

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "moral",
    "good", "bright-polished", and "generous", which are assigned a sentiment score
    of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any negative words that would
    flip the sentiment score.

    4. Emphasis Analysis: The text contains words that convey emphasis such as "incredible",
    "best", and "purest", which increase the sentiment score of the preceding tokens
    by 0.5.

    5. Negation Analysis: The text does not contain any words that negate sentiment.

    6. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    the sentiment scores of individual tokens, which is positive.

    7. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value of 0.5,
    so the text is classified as "positive".

    8. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or neutral words
    that would affect the classification.


    The text expresses a positive sentiment towards the moral powers and their influence,
    highlighting their importance and value. The language used is also positive, with
    words such as "generous", "purest", and "bright-polished" conveying a sense of
    admiration and appreciation.'
