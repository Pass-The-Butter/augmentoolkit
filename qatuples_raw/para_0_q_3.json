    "In the context of sabotage, what does the text suggest about the conditions under which acts of easy sabotage can be effectively carried out?",
    "In the context of sabotage, the text suggests that acts of easy sabotage can be effectively carried out when the saboteur can pretend stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. It also implies that these acts should lead to results that are detrimental to the enemy. As for when to stay and when to leave after committing an act of sabotage, the text advises against lingering around to see what happens and to instead leave when necessary and when circumstances permit. This is to avoid arousing suspicion.",
    "Frequently you can \u201cget away\u201d with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. (4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda. (1) _Under General Conditions_ (a) Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief, and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy.",
