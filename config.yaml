  LOGICAL_MODEL: "NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO" # model used for everything except conversation generation at the very end
  LARGE_LOGICAL_MODEL: "NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO" # model used for conversation generation at the very end. A pretty tough task, if ASSISTANT_MODE isn't on.
SYSTEM:
  USE_FILENAMES: True # give the AI context from the filenames provided to it. Useful if the filenames are meaningful, otherwise turn them off.
  ASSISTANT_MODE: True # If False, the conversations generated are between a user and an AI assistant. If True, the generated convs are between fictional characters in historical or fictional settings, with randomized personalities (some are nsfw by default, because a lot of model creators make models for that purpose. Change this (or amplify it) in ./augmentoolkit/generation_functions/special_instructions.py, it only requires changes to some strings.)
  DOUBLE_CHECK_COUNTER: 3 # How many times to check a question and answer pair during each validation step. Majority vote decides if it passes that step. There are three steps. So most questions are by default checked around 9 times (fewer if the first two checks for a step pass, obviously).
  USE_SUBSET: True # Whether to take only the first 13 chunks from a text during the run. Useful for experimenting and iterating and seeing all the steps without costing too much money or time.
  REARRANGEMENTS_TO_TAKE: 3 # How many times to rearrange the questions and answers for generating different conversations from the same group of questions and answers.
  CONCURRENCY_LIMIT: 50 # Hard limit of how many calls can be run at the same time, useful for API mode (aphrodite automatically manages this and queues things, as far as I know)
