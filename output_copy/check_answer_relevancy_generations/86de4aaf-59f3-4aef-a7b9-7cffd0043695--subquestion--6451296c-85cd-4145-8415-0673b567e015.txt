"""
Polar bears are primarily found in the Arctic Circle, where they have adapted to the harsh cold environment. Their diet is primarily based on marine mammals, with seals being the most crucial part of their diet. Polar bears are skilled hunters, often waiting by seals' breathing holes to catch their prey. Occasionally, they also eat birds, bird eggs, and small mammals. They also consume significant amounts of berries and fish. These bears are known for their ability to survive in extreme conditions, thanks to their thick fur and fat layers which provide insulation, as well as their efficient digestion system, which makes good use of the few nutrients available.
"""

Question (based on text): """What are the primary food sources of polar bears?"""

The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry, stating that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This theorem is often expressed as the equation a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle, and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Historically, this theorem has been attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras, although evidence suggests it was known to mathematicians in several cultures before him.

Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist and the father of psychoanalysis, introduced the concept of the unconscious mind. He suggested that the unconscious mind stores feelings, thoughts, and desires that are too threatening or painful for conscious awareness. Freud believed that these repressed elements could influence behavior and personality. One of his key methods for exploring the unconscious mind was through dream analysis, where he interpreted the meaning of dreams as a pathway to understanding the hidden desires and thoughts of the individual. Freud also developed the theory of the Oedipus complex, which proposes that during the phallic stage of psychosexual development, a male child experiences unconscious sexual desires for his mother and hostility toward his father.

"""
The planet Venus has a very dense atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This composition creates a runaway greenhouse effect, leading to surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Venus rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is longer than its orbital period around the Sun. Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system. This retrograde rotation is thought to be the result of a collision with a large celestial body early in its history.

Text: """Frequently you can “get away” with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. (4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda.
