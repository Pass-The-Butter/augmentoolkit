You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.

Details of the text the paragraphs were sourced from: """Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"""

Question: """What does the Office of Strategic Services suggest may be the effects of simple sabotage in 'Simple Sabotage'?"""
Answer: """The Office of Strategic Services suggests that simple sabotage may cause delays, create confusion, and hinder efficiency."""

Question: """How do the characteristics of simple sabotage help facilitate its execution?"""
Answer: """Characteristics like not requiring specially prepared tools or equipment, a citizen-saboteur not needing to act within an organized group, and a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal, facilitate the execution of simple sabotage. These factors mean that ordinary individuals can perform acts of sabotage without needing significant resources or posing a significant risk to themselves."""

Question: """In what ways does the 'Simple Sabotage' manual reduce the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur?"""
Answer: """The manual reduces the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur by outlining methods of sabotage that do not require specialized tools or equipment, do not necessitate active connection with an organized group, and can be executed by ordinary citizens. Additionally, the sabotage methods are designed to limit the chances of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

Question: """How does the text define "simple sabotage" and distinguish it from other forms of sabotage?"""
Answer: """The text defines "simple sabotage" as a type of sabotage that does not require specially prepared tools or equipment, and can be executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group. It is differentiated from other forms of sabotage by its comparative ease of execution and the lack of danger and risk involved."""

Question: """What does the term 'simple sabotage' refer to?"""
Answer: """'Simple sabotage' refers to a type of sabotage that doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; can be executed by an ordinary citizen, individually or within an organized group; and is carried out in a way that minimizes danger of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is amiddle-aged, middle-class American housewife in the 1940s who has been tasked with disseminating the 'Simple Sabotage' manual. She is neither particularly bold nor particularly timid, and has both good and bad sides: she's dedicated to her family and her country, but she's also somewhat paranoid and suspicious, seeing potential spies and enemies everywhere she goes. She is not the author of the manual, but she agrees with its ideas and sees the potential for simple sabotage to help the war effort. This character's personality traits, like her paranoia and her dedication to her country, can't really tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but they can relate to her backstory and her profession -- maybe she's the one distributing the manual to other ordinary citizens.

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
But since my intent is to write something useful to whoever understands it, it has appeared to me more fitting to go after the effectual truth of the thing than to the imagination of it. And many have imagined republics and principalities that have never been seen or known to exist in truth; for it is so far from how one lives to how one should live that he who lets go of what is done for what should be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation. For a man who wants to make a profession of good in all regards must come to ruin among so many who are not good. Hence it is necessary to a prince, if he wants to maintain himself, to learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use it, according to the necessity of the case.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young, highly educated nun in a medieval convent. She is a religious fanatic, extremely devout and pious, and sees the world in black and white terms, with no room for compromise or nuance. She is highly educated, having spent years studying theology and philosophy, which has only served to reinforce her religious fanaticism. She is not the author of 'The Prince', but she agrees with its ideas and sees them as a practical guide to maintaining power in a corrupt world. This character's personality traits, like her religious fanaticism and her education, can't really tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but they can relate to her backstory and her profession -- maybe she's using 'The Prince' as a guide to understanding the corrupt world outside her convent.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a retired military general in his 60s, who has seen too much war and too much death to believe in anything anymore. He is cynical and jaded, and has turned to heavy drinking to numb the pain of his past experiences. Despite his cynicism, he is still highly knowledgeable about military strategy and tactics, and has a deep understanding of Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War'. He may have even used the book as a guide during his own military career. This character's personality traits, like his cynicism and his drinking, can't really tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but they can relate to his backstory and his profession -- maybe he's using his knowledge of 'The Art of War' to analyze current military conflicts, or to teach younger officers about the realities of war.

He is a staunch capitalist, and sees communism as a dangerous and destructive ideology that threatens his way of life. Despite his anti-communist views, he is still highly knowledgeable about Marxist theory, and has a deep understanding of 'The Communist Manifesto'.

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?

I believe that to be true.

Then if a man who has been schooled in true opinions on politics - a rare thing in our day - comes to a city with a democratic constitution, and if there be some touch of poetry in his nature, and he seeks to gain power, my belief is that in such efforts he would often fail, and his life would be embittered; for he may perhaps find it impossible to satisfy the taste of the multitude, and yet he may not venture to adopt the popular mode of speaking and acting.

True.

And if he were able to gratify them, and to live in this way, would he not be in a miserable state? For surely he will have nothing in common with himself, or his own class, and he will be continually filled with unrighteous anger against himself and them, because he will see that they are altogether ignorant of what is best and truest, and yet they have the power in their hands, and are able to do whatever they please with him and his belongings.

Very true.

And is not this the reason why, ever since there came into being in cities democracies, which are the most beautiful of all forms of government, there have been many changes, and many tyrannies have sprung up in them? For the good and the evil are so curiously mingled in them, that it is impossible to determine which prevails.

That is very true, he said.

And in such cities the true lover of knowledge and wisdom will be least at home, for he will be unable to share with the citizens in their wrongdoing?

That is true, he replied.

Question: """What does Plato mean when he says that 'the good and the evil are so curiously mingled in [democracies] that it is impossible to determine which prevails'?"""
Answer: """Plato means that in democratic societies, there is a mix of good and evil, and it can be difficult to determine which is more prevalent. He argues that this can lead to instability and the rise of tyranny, as the people are easily swayed by popular opinions and rhetoric."""

Question: """What does Plato suggest is the fate of a philosopher who tries to gain power in a democratic city?"""
Answer: """Plato suggests that a philosopher who tries to gain power in a democratic city may fail, or may be forced to adopt popular modes of speaking and acting in order to gain the support of the people.
