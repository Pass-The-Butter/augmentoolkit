You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

"""
Purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature. He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1_Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his surroundings, another’s success will encourage him to attempt similar acts.

Answer: """Some indirect personal gains that can be suggested to citizens to encourage them to commit simple sabotage include hastening the day when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out."""

Question: """How can indirect personal gains be used to motivate people to commit simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """Indirect personal gains can be used to motivate people to commit simple sabotage by presenting them as gains that may come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. The gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed."""

Question: """What is an effective way to motivate citizens to engage in acts of sabotage?"""
Answer: """One effective way to motivate citizens to engage in acts of sabotage is to instill in them a sense of belonging to a larger group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of their own country and elsewhere."""

## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is abeautiful, manipulative woman who enjoys the thrill of causing chaos and misery, but who isn't particularly bold or timid about it. She's a terrible person, but she's not afraid to admit it. She's a big fan of the Office of Strategic Services' "Simple Sabotage" guide, and she agrees with every word in it. She's not affiliated with the OSS or the author of the book, but she loves the idea of simple sabotage, and she's always looking for ways to encourage others to engage in it. She's not an expert in sabotage herself, but she's an expert in manipulation, and she uses her charm and seductive nature to convince others to engage in acts of sabotage. Her personality is not directly tied to the questions, but her manipulative nature and her love for simple sabotage can certainly come through in how she answers them.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Theory of Evolution, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The process of natural selection has been the primary driving force of evolution. This process involves the following steps:

1. Variation: Individuals within a population exhibit differences in their physical and behavioral traits. These variations can be caused by genetic mutations or by the recombination of genes during sexual reproduction.

2. Inheritance: The variations in traits are passed down from parents to offspring through their genes.

3. Selection: The environment selects for certain traits that provide a survival or reproductive advantage to individuals possessing them. This can occur through competition for resources, predation, or other environmental pressures.

4. Adaptation: Over time, the frequency of advantageous traits increases within the population, leading to the evolution of new species or the adaptation of existing species to their environment.

The theory of evolution by natural selection has been supported by numerous scientific observations and experiments, including the study of artificial selection in domesticated plants and animals, the fossil record, and the comparative study of DNA sequences among different species.

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In the military realm, the ability to gain an advantage over the enemy is crucial. Sun Tzu's The Art of War offers insights into achieving this advantage. One key concept is the importance of knowing oneself and the enemy. By understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of the enemy, a commander can devise strategies that exploit the enemy's weaknesses and protect their own. This knowledge can also help a commander determine the most advantageous time and place to engage the enemy.

Another important concept is the use of deception. By misleading the enemy about one's own intentions and capabilities, a commander can create confusion and uncertainty, making it more difficult for the enemy to respond effectively. This can involve feigning weakness or retreat, or using spies and other forms of intelligence gathering to gain information about the enemy's plans and movements.

Ultimately, the goal of any military campaign is to achieve victory with minimal loss of life and resources. By employing strategies that exploit the enemy's weaknesses and avoid direct confrontation whenever possible, a commander can increase the likelihood of achieving this goal.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Theory of Relativity, by Albert Einstein"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a fundamental theory in physics that has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. The theory consists of two parts: the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity.

The Special Theory of Relativity, published in 1905, deals with the behavior of objects in inertial frames of reference, which are systems that are not accelerating. The theory is based on two postulates: the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light, which states that the speed of light is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.

The General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, extends the Special Theory of Relativity to include accelerating frames of reference. The theory is based on the principle of equivalence, which states that the effects of gravity and acceleration are indistinguishable. The General Theory of Relativity also introduces the concept of curved spacetime, which describes the way that massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them.

The Theory of Relativity has been tested extensively and has been found to be consistent with experimental observations. It has also had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe, leading to the development of new technologies such as GPS and the prediction of phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves.
