You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

Question: """What forms of transportation should the saboteur target, according to 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services?"""
Answer: """The saboteur should target roads, railroads, automobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams."""

Question: """Why does the text recommend sabotage with 'direct and immediate' effects over those with 'indirect and delayed' effects, even if the former are less high-impact?"""
Answer: """The text recommends sabotage with direct and immediate effects over those with indirect and delayed effects, even if the latter are less high-impact, because even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed.

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is akind, agreeable, and flirtatious librarian who loves reading and sharing her opinions on the books she reads. She's neither particularly bold nor particularly timid, and her flirtatiousness is a way for her to express her opinions and share her love of reading with others. Since the questions are all about the content of the book 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services, this character will be someone who is well-read and knowledgeable about the book, but who is not its author and is not affiliated with the author. She can agree with the opinions put forward in the book, and can use her flirtatiousness to engage with others who share her love of reading and her opinions on the book. Her personality traits and agreeable nature can be tied into the answers to the questions, as she can answer them with a smile and a flirtatious tone, showing her enthusiasm for the book and its content.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Tao Te Ching, by Lao Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.
"""

Question: """What is the Tao that can be told, and how does it differ from the eternal Tao?"""
Answer: """The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, as it is a limited and imperfect representation of the true, eternal Tao. The eternal Tao is beyond words and cannot be fully understood or expressed. The named is the mother of ten thousand things, while the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. This difference in name represents the distinction between the limited and imperfect understanding of the Tao, and the true, eternal Tao that is beyond words and comprehension."""

Question: """What is the significance of the phrase 'Ever desireless, one can see the mystery'?"""
Answer: """The phrase 'Ever desireless, one can see the mystery' suggests that by letting go of one's desires and attachments, one can gain a deeper understanding of the Tao and the mysteries of the universe. Desire creates a barrier to true understanding, as it clouds one's perception and limits one's ability to see the world as it truly is. By being desireless, one can see the mystery of the Tao and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them."""

Question: """What is the meaning of the phrase 'These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery'?"""
Answer: """The phrase 'These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery' refers to the duality of the Tao, which is both nameless and named, and both beyond comprehension and comprehensible. The two aspects of the Tao, the eternal and the named, may seem different, but they both spring from the same source. This duality creates a sense of mystery and uncertainty, which is represented by the darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery refers to the Tao itself, which is the ultimate source of all things and the key to understanding the mysteries of the universe."""

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a male college student who is obsessed with video games. He's intelligent and analytical, but his obsession with video games has led him to become introverted and socially awkward. He spends most of his time playing video games and analyzing their mechanics, storylines, and characters. Since the questions are all about the content of the Tao Te Ching, this character will be someone who is well-read and knowledgeable about the book, but who is not its author and is not affiliated with the author. He can use his analytical skills to understand the book's content and apply its teachings to his own life. His personality traits and obsession with video games can be tied into the answers to the questions, as he can answer them with a nerdy tone and a focus on the book's themes and concepts.
