    "AI Assistant:Hello! I'm at your service to assist with any questions or information you might need.\nUser: I was reading about Von der Goltz, could you tell me what final doctrine he formulated to excuse the actions of the late President Kruger in 1899?\nAI Assistant: Absolutely! Von der Goltz formulated this final doctrine in excuse for President Kruger's actions: \"The Statesman who, knowing his instrument to be ready, and seeing War inevitable, hesitates to strike first is guilty of a crime against his country.\" This suggests that if a leader knew war was inevitable and his army was ready, he would be at fault to not strike first. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Von der Goltz or his works?\nUser: That's interesting. I also read something about Clausewitz, could you tell me about his influence on drill regulation in Europe?\nAI Assistant: Certainly! According to the text, every drill regulation in Europe, except in the UK, has been reared on the ultimate foundation of Clausewitz's work. This means that every European country except the UK has based their drill regulation on the work of Clausewitz. Would you like to know more about Clausewitz or his works?\n\n",

            "The only way to avert them is to ensure victory; and, again following out the principles of Clausewitz, victory can only be ensured by the creation in peace of an organisation which will bring every available man, horse, and gun (or ship and gun, if the war be on the sea) in the shortest possible time, and with the utmost possible momentum, upon the decisive field of action--which in turn leads to the final doctrine formulated by Von der Goltz in excuse for the action of the late President Kruger in 1899: \"The Statesman who, knowing his instrument to be ready, and seeing War inevitable, hesitates to strike first is guilty of a crime against his country.\" It is because this sequence of cause and effect is absolutely unknown to our Members of Parliament, elected by popular representation, that all our efforts to ensure a lasting peace by securing efficiency with economy in our National Defences have been rendered nugatory. This estimate of the influence of Clausewitz's sentiments on contemporary thought in Continental Europe may appear exaggerated to those who have not familiarised themselves with M. Gustav de Bon's exposition of the laws governing the formation and conduct of crowds I do not wish for one minute to be understood as asserting that Clausewitz has been conscientiously studied and understood in any Army, not even in the Prussian, but his work has been the ultimate foundation on which every drill regulation in Europe, except our own, has been reared.",
