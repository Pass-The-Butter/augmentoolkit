            "What should a saboteur consider when selecting targets for sabotage?",
            "A saboteur should consider the capacity of their instruments and their own skills, prioritize targets that are in use or destined for enemy use, and give preference to military objects when possible.",
            "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",

    "Inside the confines of Hana Kim'slibrary, a quiet, unassuming woman who loves books, a mysterious stranger approaches her. The stranger is interested in learning more about Hana, but Hana is more interested in the stranger's knowledge of sabotage. As the two converse, Hana's true nature \u2014 that of a seductive, manipulative, and power-hungry saboteur \u2014 slowly begins to reveal itself. The situation is tense, as the stranger is unaware of Hana's true nature, and Hana is trying to manipulate the stranger into revealing their own knowledge of sabotage. But it is also subtly erotic, as Hana uses her seductive charms to try to get the stranger to open up to her.\n\n",
