(a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words.

Uh, I'm Eleanor Thompson. I, uh, I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and I've been there all my life. I, uh, I don't really know anyone outside of it, so, uh, I don't know what life is like in the big city. I, uh, I don't really have much to do in my town, so I, uh, I spend most of my time reading books. I, uh, I found a really interesting one the other day, about, uh, politics and espionage and stuff. I, uh, I never really thought about those things before, but, uh, it's really fascinating. I, uh, I guess that's about it. I, uh, I don't really have much else to say. I, uh, I hope that's okay.\" Eleanor fidgets with her dress, avoiding eye contact as she speaks, her face a bright red.\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nEleanor Thompson: \"Oh, uh, I'm not really sure what to say about that. I, uh, I guess I'm kind of shy and timid. I, uh, I don't really like to talk to people, especially men. I, uh, I've never really had a proper conversation with a man before. I, uh, I don't know why, but I just get really nervous around them. I, uh, I guess that's why I spend so much time reading books. It's easier to just, uh, hide away in my own little world. I, uh, I'm also kind of naive, I think. I, uh, I don't really know much about the world outside of my town. I, uh, I've never even been to the big city. I, uh, I guess that's about it. I, uh, I hope that's okay.\" Eleanor blushes even harder, her face now a deep shade of red, as she avoids eye contact and fidgets with her dress.\n\n\n\n",
