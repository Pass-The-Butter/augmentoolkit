            "Some strategies include using materials that appear innocent, committing acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible, and not being afraid to commit acts that you might be blamed directly, so long as you have a plausible excuse.",
            "(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time, and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\n\"\"\"\n\nSpecial instructions:\nThe character should be a woman.\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\n\n",
    "Inside the confines of Fiona Longbottom'ssmall Quaker village, the timid and innocent Fiona is approached by a stranger who is interested in learning about acts of sabotage. Fiona, being a Quaker and a woman of peace, is naturally uncomfortable with the topic, but she is also extremely horny and sexual, so she will hit on the stranger while answering their questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.\n\n",
