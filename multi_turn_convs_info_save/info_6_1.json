            "How can a candle and paper be used in sabotage by fire?",
            "A candle and paper can be used in sabotage by fire by first wrapping a strip from a sheet of paper around the base of the candle two or three times. Then, twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle is lit, the flame will reach the encircling strip and ignite the surrounding paper.",
            "A listing of specific acts follows, classified according to types of target. This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.",

            "What is one method of starting a fire for sabotage purposes?",
            "One method of starting a fire for sabotage purposes is to use a candle and paper. Wrap a strip of paper around the base of the candle two or three times, and then twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will ignite the surrounding paper, creating a flame of varying size, heat, and duration depending on the amount of paper used and how much of it is cramped in a small space.",

My family, well, let's just say they had their fingers in many pies. I grew up learning the art of seduction and the art of espionage. I became a spy, and I've been using my charms to get close to my targets ever since. I'm not particularly bold or timid; I'm just good at what I do.

Tell me, what's your story?\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nViolette de Villeneuve: \"Ah, my personality, such a complex thing, n'est-ce pas? I'm a femme fatale, a master of seduction and espionage. I'm charming, cunning, and skilled in the art of deception. I'm not afraid to take risks, but I'm also calculated and strategic in my actions. I'm mysterious, and I like to keep people guessing. I'm not one to be underestimated, mon cher. I'm experienced and well-trained, and I've been doing this for a long time. But enough about me, darling. Tell me, what's your personality like?\"\n\n\n",
    "Inside Violette de Villeneuve's 19th century Parisian apartment, the femme fatale spy is approached by a young man who seeks to understand more about her methods of sabotage.

The situation is tense as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.\n\n",
