            "How do the fuse types differ?",
            "The first type of fuse suggested is simple, made by soaking one end of a piece of string in grease, then applying a pinch of gunpowder to the cross-section where grease-soaked string meets clean string. When this ignites, the string will burn slowly and without a flame until it reaches the grease and gunpowder, where it will flare up suddenly. The second type of fuse suggested makes use of matches instead of grease and gunpowder; the string is simply run over match heads, and the same effect will be achieved. The advantage of both fuses is that string burns at a set speed, allowing the ignition to be timed by the length and thickness of the string.",
            "(2) With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.",

    "Amidst the surroundings of 18th century America, Ava Grace \u2014 a shy, timid, and devout Christian woman \u2014 is approached by a fellow villager who seeks her knowledge on ignition methods. While Ava is fascinated by fire and flames, she is also chaste and puritanical, and has never had a sexual experience. The villager, unaware of Ava's peculiarities, simply wants to understand how to ignite different materials better, but Ava, compelled by her personality, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.\n\n",
