    "What is the goal of the Germans and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in regards to the re-arrangement of the world?",
    "The German Empire and its Ally, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, want to re-arrange the world so that the German speech, culture, and tradition become the predominant influences in Europe and potentially the whole world.",
    "But the particular way in which those stones may be used, the combinations into which they may be grouped, the main influences which are to impose themselves upon particular great agglomerations of new nationalities are the whole issue of the debate, and form the whole subject of this war.The German Empire and its Ally, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy--that is, the reigning house of Hapsburg-Lorraine--wants the re-arrangement to take a certain form which would leave the German speech and culture and tradition the predominating thing in Europe, and probably in the whole world.The Allies, upon the other hand, are fighting for a less simple idea. They are fighting for the double conception of:(_a_) Retaining the existing independence of certain  national groups.(_b_) Erecting other independent or partly independent  groups, the existence of which and the general influence  of which shall restrict German and in particular Prussian  power.This dual conception the Allies rightly term the preservation and the extension of national liberties in Europe.Now before we can comprehend either what the Germans are striving for or what the Allies are striving for, we must make a catalogue of those national groups which are at the foundation of the whole business. In making that catalogue we must remember what it is that creates a national group.[Illustration: MAP I.
