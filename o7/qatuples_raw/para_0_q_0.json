    "What are the two postulates that must be recognized regarding the goals of the Germans and the Allies?",
    "The two postulates that must be recognized regarding the goals of the Germans and the Allies are as follows:\n\n1. In modern Europe, it is no longer the goal of any nation to annex the territories and white men of other nations. This is due to the difficulties and negative consequences that have been seen when such annexations have been attempted in the past, such as with Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and the Austro-Hungarian governments.\n2. It is universally recognized that the political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond with the true national groupings, and can conflict with the realities of national life. This can be seen in the example of the Finnish provinces of Russia, and the recognition of an Irish nationality.",
    "Now, before attempting to determine in a graphic fashion what those two ideals are--before, that is, trying to draw two maps which shall represent respectively the German goal and the goal of the Allies, we must lay down certain postulates which are not always recognized but which are certainly true.Unless we recognize their truth we shall come to accept wild statements, and to be frightened of those ridiculous prophecies which propose the extermination of Germany on the one hand, or the rule of the German government over England or France on the other.I. The first of these postulates is that a modern European nation no longer desires to _annex_ white men in Europe, and the territory they inhabit.The example of Alsace-Lorraine alone has proved a sufficient lesson; the continued vitality of Poland after a hundred years has proved another, and even the difficulties of the Austro-Hungarian governments, with their subject races, a third. This does not mean that a modern European government would not annex in any circumstance. The possession of some all-important military or commercial point might occasionally make the perilous experiment worth while. But it means that the idea of annexation as an obvious corollary to military success has disappeared.II. The second postulate is as follows: It is universally recognized--by the Germans quite as much as by ourselves--that the political boundaries so long established in Europe hardly ever correspond to exact national groupings, and very often violently conflict with the realities of national life.No one is so foolish, for instance, as to pretend that the Finnish provinces of Russia are not quite separate from the rest of the Czar\u2019s dominions in tradition, and consciousness, and habit, and all the rest that makes a nation. No one in England now denies the existence of an Irish nationality.",
