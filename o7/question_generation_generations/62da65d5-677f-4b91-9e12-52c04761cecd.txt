    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the
    earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?


    **ANSWER:**

    Under this new scale, the moon would be two and a half feet from the earth.


    **QUESTION:**

    How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?


    **ANSWER:**

    The distances between planets is much greater than the planets'' sizes. For example,
    if you shrunk everything down so that the earth was one inch in diameter, then
    the sun would be 323 yards away.


    **QUESTION:**

    If you scaled everything down so that the earth had a diameter of one inch, then
    how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?

  role: user
- content: '**QUESTION:**

    How can I park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that
    token launches, using the command line?


    **ANSWER:**

    To park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token before the token launches, you
    can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]''

    ```


    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After
    the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet,
    or you will have your original CSRVTEST amount returned.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, which can
    be converted to with either GOLD or CSRVTEST? Assume that GOLD is a new token
    that just launched.


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, you must
    run a command to define the currency''s properties. Here''s an example of such
    a command:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["CSRVTEST",
    "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000''

    ```


    This command defines a new token named "mycoin". Some important notes about this
    configuration:


    1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it''s set to PROOF_CHAINID. This
    means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.

    2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.

    3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.

    4. `"minpreconversion": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of CSRVTEST
    and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.

    5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.


    **QUESTION:**

    What does it mean if `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?


    **ANSWER:**

    When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the
    proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the
    chain ID may mint new tokens. This can be done with a command like the following
    example:

    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" ''[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]''

    ```


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I define a new blockchain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can define a new blockchain using a single command. You need to pass two JSON
    objects, one for the new blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults
    of the bridge. Here''s an example of how to define a new blockchain:


    ```shell

    ./surev -chain=csrvtest definecurrency ''{"name":"NewChain","options":264,"currencies":["CSRVTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}''
    ''{"currencies":["CSRVTEST","NewChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}''

    ```


    Note the following important information used when defining the new blockchain:


    1. The "name" field defines the name of the chain.

    2. The "options" property is an integer, in this case it''s set to 264.

    2. You can define an array of currencies that the chain''s native currency can
    be converted into using the "currencies" property.

    3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency,
    and each currency on the chain, using the "conversions" property.

    4. The "eras" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end
    of each "era" in the chain''s lifecycle

    5. "notaries" is a list of the notaries on the chain.

    6. "minnotariesconfirm" is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed
    to confirm a block.

    7. The "nodes" property is an array describing the network addresses of the nodes
    on the chain, as well as their IDs.


    Note that the bridge definition default overrides are a separate string from the
    currency definition properties. The bridge can be used to move funds on and off
    the bew chain. The bridge''s JSON object has some of its own properties:

    1. `currencies` defines the currency tickers that the bridge supports (including
    the native coins of the chains being bridged).

    2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each currency in
    the bridge.

    3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the bridge''s native token.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I export an ID to a new chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can accomplish this with the sendcurrency command. Here''s an example, where
    the ID "IDNAME@" is exported to "NewChainName."


    ```

    surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"NewChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"CSRVTEST"}]''

    ```


    Some parts of this command you should be aware of:

    1. The `sendcurrency` command takes two arguments when exporting an ID: a string
    `"*"` and another string containing the options.

    2. `address` is the ID being exported.

    3. `exportto` is the chain being exported to.

    4. `exportid` indicates that in this case, `sendcurrency` is being used to export
    an ID.

    5. `amount` specifies the amount of currency being sent.

    6. `currency` specifies the type of currency being sent.'

    What is the Declaration of St. Petersburg, and what issue does it pose for those
    who support war?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Declaration of St. Petersburg is an agreement between nations that is capable
    of indefinite expansion. It poses a problem for those who support war because
    it sets a precedent for enforcing agreements between nations, which could potentially
    lead to the creation of an arbitration tribunal and the reduction of war.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main argument against the idea that increases in the peril of war
    lead to its ultimate cessation?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main argument against this idea is that the whole history of war has been
    a steady increase in the pains and perils of war as more effective weapons of
    destruction have been developed. This suggests that increases in the peril of
    war do not lead to its cessation, but rather to its continuation and escalation.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is your opinion on the idea that every discovery in the art of war has a
    life-saving and peace-promoting influence?


    **ANSWER:**

    I believe that this idea is a delusion. The history of war shows that increases
    in the effectiveness of weapons of destruction lead to greater suffering and peril,
    rather than to peace and the cessation of war.'

    \ in a graphic fashion what those two ideals are--before, that is, trying to draw\
    \ two maps which shall represent respectively the German goal and the goal of\
    \ the Allies, we must lay down certain postulates which are not always recognized\
    \ but which are certainly true.Unless we recognize their truth we shall come to\
    \ accept wild statements, and to be frightened of those ridiculous prophecies\
    \ which propose the extermination of Germany on the one hand, or the rule of the\
    \ German government over England or France on the other.I. The first of these\
    \ postulates is that a modern European nation no longer desires to _annex_ white\
    \ men in Europe, and the territory they inhabit.The example of Alsace-Lorraine\
    \ alone has proved a sufficient lesson; the continued vitality of Poland after\
    \ a hundred years has proved another, and even the difficulties of the Austro-Hungarian\
    \ governments, with their subject races, a third. This does not mean that a modern\
    \ European government would not annex in any circumstance. The possession of some\
    \ all-important military or commercial point might occasionally make the perilous\
    \ experiment worth while. But it means that the idea of annexation as an obvious\
    \ corollary to military success has disappeared.II. The second postulate is as\
    \ follows: It is universally recognized--by the Germans quite as much as by ourselves--that\
    \ the political boundaries so long established in Europe hardly ever correspond\
    \ to exact national groupings, and very often violently conflict with the realities\
    \ of national life.No one is so foolish, for instance, as to pretend that the\
    \ Finnish provinces of Russia are not quite separate from the rest of the Czar\u2019\
    s dominions in tradition, and consciousness, and habit, and all the rest that\
    \ makes a nation. No one in England now denies the existence of an Irish nationality.\n\

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What are the two postulates that must be recognized regarding the goals of the
    Germans and the Allies?


    **ANSWER:**

    The two postulates that must be recognized regarding the goals of the Germans
    and the Allies are as follows:


    1. In modern Europe, it is no longer the goal of any nation to annex the territories
    and white men of other nations. This is due to the difficulties and negative consequences
    that have been seen when such annexations have been attempted in the past, such
    as with Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and the Austro-Hungarian governments.

    2. It is universally recognized that the political boundaries in Europe often
    do not correspond with the true national groupings, and can conflict with the
    realities of national life. This can be seen in the example of the Finnish provinces
    of Russia, and the recognition of an Irish nationality.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is an example of an attempt to annex territories and white men in modern
    Europe that ended in failure?


    **ANSWER:**

    One example of an attempt to annex territories and white men in modern Europe
    that ended in failure is the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany. The difficulties
    and negative consequences that resulted from this annexation led to a recognition
    that such attempts are no longer desirable or practical.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main reason that modern European governments are no longer interested
    in annexing territories and white men?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main reason that modern European governments are no longer interested in annexing
    territories and white men is that the difficulties and negative consequences of
    such attempts have led to a recognition that they are not desirable or practical.
    This can be seen in the examples of Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and the Austro-Hungarian
    governments.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is an example of a political boundary in Europe that conflicts with the realities
    of national life?


    **ANSWER:**

    One example of a political boundary in Europe that conflicts with the realities
    of national life is the boundary between Russia and the Finnish provinces. The
    Finnish provinces have a separate tradition, consciousness, and habit that makes
    them a distinct nation, despite their political inclusion in Russia. This is an
    example of how political boundaries do not always correspond with the true national
    groupings. Similarly, the recognition of an Irish nationality despite their inclusion
    in the United Kingdom is another example of this phenomenon.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main reason that political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond
    with the realities of national life?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main reason that political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond with
    the realities of national life is that these boundaries were often created for
    political or historical reasons, rather than based on the true cultural and linguistic
    groupings of the people who live in those regions. This can lead to conflicts
    and tensions between different groups, as they do not feel that the political
    boundaries accurately represent their national identity. This can also result
    in a sense of injustice and frustration among those who feel that their national
    identity is not being properly recognized or represented. Additionally, it can
    lead to a sense of disconnection from the political process, as people may feel
    that their national identity is not being considered in decision-making. This
    can lead to a lack of trust in the political system, and a feeling of alienation
    from the political process. Finally, it can also lead to a sense of insecurity
    and uncertainty, as people may feel that their national identity is not being
    properly protected or represented.

    is that they were not created based on the true cultural and linguistic groupings
    of the people who live in those regions, and as a result, it can lead to conflicts,

    sense of insecurity. All of these factors can have a negative impact on the relationship
    between different groups and can lead to a feeling of disconnect from the political
    process. Additionally, it can also lead to a feeling of alienation and a lack
    of trust in the political system, which can ultimately lead to a breakdown in
    communication and cooperation between different groups. Overall, the main reason
    that political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond with the realities
    of national life is that they were not created based on the true cultural and
    linguistic groupings of the people who live in those regions, and as a result,
    it can lead to conflicts, tensions, a sense of injustice, a lack of trust in the
    political system, and a sense of insecurity. This can have a negative impact on
    the relationship between different groups, and can ultimately lead to a breakdown
    in communication and cooperation, which can further exacerbate the issues and
    make it difficult to find a solution to the problem. In conclusion, the main reason
    that political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond with the realities
    of national life is that they were not created based on the true cultural and

    and cooperation, which can further exacerbate the issues and make it difficult
    to find a solution to the problem. Therefore, it is important to recognize that
    political boundaries in Europe often do not correspond with the realities of national
    life, and to work towards finding a solution that takes into account the true
    cultural and linguistic groupings of the people who live in those regions. This
    can help to reduce conflicts and tensions, and promote a sense of unity and cooperation
    between different groups. Ultimately, this will help to create a more peaceful
    and stable Europe. All of these factors must be taken into consideration when
    addressing the problem of political boundaries in Europe, to ensure that the solution
    found is one that is fair, just, and sustainable for all parties involved. With
    a comprehensive understanding of the underlying issues and an open dialogue between
    all parties, it will be possible to find a solution that respects the true cultural
    and linguistic groupings of the people who live in those regions, and that promotes
