    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the
    earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?


    **ANSWER:**

    Under this new scale, the moon would be two and a half feet from the earth.


    **QUESTION:**

    How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?


    **ANSWER:**

    The distances between planets is much greater than the planets'' sizes. For example,
    if you shrunk everything down so that the earth was one inch in diameter, then
    the sun would be 323 yards away.


    **QUESTION:**

    If you scaled everything down so that the earth had a diameter of one inch, then
    how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?

  role: user
- content: '**QUESTION:**

    How can I park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that
    token launches, using the command line?


    **ANSWER:**

    To park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token before the token launches, you
    can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]''

    ```


    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After
    the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet,
    or you will have your original CSRVTEST amount returned.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, which can
    be converted to with either GOLD or CSRVTEST? Assume that GOLD is a new token
    that just launched.


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, you must
    run a command to define the currency''s properties. Here''s an example of such
    a command:


    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST definecurrency ''{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["CSRVTEST",
    "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000''

    ```


    This command defines a new token named "mycoin". Some important notes about this
    configuration:


    1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it''s set to PROOF_CHAINID. This
    means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.

    2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.

    3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.

    4. `"minpreconversion": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of CSRVTEST
    and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.

    5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.


    **QUESTION:**

    What does it mean if `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?


    **ANSWER:**

    When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the
    proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the
    chain ID may mint new tokens. This can be done with a command like the following
    example:

    ```

    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" ''[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]''

    ```


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I define a new blockchain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can define a new blockchain using a single command. You need to pass two JSON
    objects, one for the new blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults
    of the bridge. Here''s an example of how to define a new blockchain:


    ```shell

    ./surev -chain=csrvtest definecurrency ''{"name":"NewChain","options":264,"currencies":["CSRVTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}''
    ''{"currencies":["CSRVTEST","NewChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}''

    ```


    Note the following important information used when defining the new blockchain:


    1. The "name" field defines the name of the chain.

    2. The "options" property is an integer, in this case it''s set to 264.

    2. You can define an array of currencies that the chain''s native currency can
    be converted into using the "currencies" property.

    3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain''s native currency,
    and each currency on the chain, using the "conversions" property.

    4. The "eras" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end
    of each "era" in the chain''s lifecycle

    5. "notaries" is a list of the notaries on the chain.

    6. "minnotariesconfirm" is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed
    to confirm a block.

    7. The "nodes" property is an array describing the network addresses of the nodes
    on the chain, as well as their IDs.


    Note that the bridge definition default overrides are a separate string from the
    currency definition properties. The bridge can be used to move funds on and off
    the bew chain. The bridge''s JSON object has some of its own properties:

    1. `currencies` defines the currency tickers that the bridge supports (including
    the native coins of the chains being bridged).

    2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each currency in
    the bridge.

    3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the bridge''s native token.


    **QUESTION:**

    How can I export an ID to a new chain?


    **ANSWER:**

    You can accomplish this with the sendcurrency command. Here''s an example, where
    the ID "IDNAME@" is exported to "NewChainName."


    ```

    surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"NewChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"CSRVTEST"}]''

    ```


    Some parts of this command you should be aware of:

    1. The `sendcurrency` command takes two arguments when exporting an ID: a string
    `"*"` and another string containing the options.

    2. `address` is the ID being exported.

    3. `exportto` is the chain being exported to.

    4. `exportid` indicates that in this case, `sendcurrency` is being used to export
    an ID.

    5. `amount` specifies the amount of currency being sent.

    6. `currency` specifies the type of currency being sent.'

    What is the Declaration of St. Petersburg, and what issue does it pose for those
    who support war?


    **ANSWER:**

    The Declaration of St. Petersburg is an agreement between nations that is capable
    of indefinite expansion. It poses a problem for those who support war because
    it sets a precedent for enforcing agreements between nations, which could potentially
    lead to the creation of an arbitration tribunal and the reduction of war.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the main argument against the idea that increases in the peril of war
    lead to its ultimate cessation?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main argument against this idea is that the whole history of war has been
    a steady increase in the pains and perils of war as more effective weapons of
    destruction have been developed. This suggests that increases in the peril of
    war do not lead to its cessation, but rather to its continuation and escalation.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is your opinion on the idea that every discovery in the art of war has a
    life-saving and peace-promoting influence?


    **ANSWER:**

    I believe that this idea is a delusion. The history of war shows that increases
    in the effectiveness of weapons of destruction lead to greater suffering and peril,
    rather than to peace and the cessation of war.'

    \ would pretend that the Serbian feeling of nationality was not very real, and\
    \ was very far from being contained by the present boundaries of Serbia.The excuse\
    \ for the old point of view--the point of view that political boundaries were\
    \ sufficient and that the true nationalities which they cut through or suppressed\
    \ might be neglected--was that in time, with the modern rapidity of communication\
    \ and the power of the modern State, these divergent elements would be _absorbed_,\
    \ or _digested into_, the greater nationality which governed them. But experience\
    \ has falsified this very reasonable conception. It has been found not only that\

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What was the old point of view regarding political boundaries and nationalities?


    **ANSWER:**

    The old point of view was that political boundaries were sufficient to contain
    nationalities and that the true nationalities which they cut through or suppressed
    might be neglected. It was believed that, with the modern rapidity of communication
    and the power of the modern state, these divergent elements would be _absorbed_,
    or _digested into_, the greater nationality which governed them.


    **QUESTION:**

    What has experience shown regarding the old point of view that divergent nationalities
    would be _absorbed_ by the greater nationality governing them?


    **ANSWER:**

    Experience has shown that this old point of view was false. Not only did this
    transformation not take place, but the old real nationalities actually got stronger.
    For example, in the case of Poland, which was artificially cut through by the
    German, Austrian, and Russian frontiers, the process of _absorption_ did not continue.
    On the contrary, the tide began to set backwards, and the conception of a united
    Poland is far stronger to-day even in the small and successful Austrian portion
    of Poland than it was thirty years ago.


    **QUESTION:**

    What have the true national groupings discovered, and how does this affect any
    proposed reconstruction of Europe?


    **ANSWER:**

    The true national groupings have discovered their power and have already begun
    to appear in real form, as it were, through the artificial political boundaries
    which divided or suppressed them. Any one, the Germans as much as the rest, proposing
    to reconstruct Europe must take account of such realities and must deal with the
    many national groups of Europe as the stones out of which the new building is
    to be erected.


    **QUESTION:**

    What is the current state of the conception of a united Poland?


    **ANSWER:**

    The conception of a united Poland is far stronger to-day even in the small and
    successful Austrian portion of Poland than it was thirty years ago. This is an
    example of how the old real nationalities have actually got stronger, despite
    efforts to _absorb_ or _digest_ them into the greater nationality which governed
    them. This shows that the true national groupings have discovered their power
    and have already begun to appear in real form, as it were, through the artificial
    political boundaries which divided or suppressed them. This is an important consideration
    for any proposed reconstruction of Europe, as it must take account of such realities
    and must deal with the many national groups of Europe as the stones out of which
    the new building is to be erected. The Germans, as much as the rest, must recognize
    this fact and adapt their plans for the reconstruction of Europe accordingly.                 .'
