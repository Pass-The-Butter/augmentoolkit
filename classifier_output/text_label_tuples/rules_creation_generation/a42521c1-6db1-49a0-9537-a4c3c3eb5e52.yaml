    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"This tactical operation was evidently\
    \ a part of a vast strategical plan matured by the French and British Commanders-in-Chief.\
    \ The general purpose of these operations aims at forcing the Germans to abandon\
    \ the North of Belgium and to retreat in France. All the tactical operations being\
    \ carried on in Flanders, on the Aisne, in Champagne and Lorraine, are parts of\
    \ this single plan and have the same object in view.[Illustration: BATTLE FIELD\
    \ OF THE FRENCH OFFENSIVE OF THE 22d OCTOBER, 1917.]The rapid campaign just conducted\
    \ by Marshal von Mackensen against the Italians in the Julian Alps, like that\
    \ he led in 1916 in the Dobrutcha and Roumania, are evidences that the old principles\
    \ of war, and especially those practised by Napoleon, are still fully adhered\
    \ to by the German armies.=2. Violation of the laws of warfare. Influence of science.=\
    \ We must acknowledge that, although the Germans had hoped in 1914 for a quick\
    \ victory gained by a few overwhelming blows, they had also, during their forty-four\
    \ years military preparation, provided for the possibility of a check, and had\
    \ equipped themselves with a mighty artillery which enabled them to hold the Western\
    \ Front while fighting against Russia.France had to make great efforts to complete\
    \ her armament in 1915. Germany had already accomplished this in a great measure\
    \ before the war commenced.It was reserved for German science, if not to render\
    \ war more bloody (the weapons used in 1914 sufficiently fulfilled this purpose),\
    \ to violate all the laws of warfare enacted by all the Governments, even by the\
    \ German Government itself.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned to each token based on its sentiment
    value.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "bloody" appears in a sentence with other negative tokens,
    which increases its sentiment score.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified, such as the German armies, France, and Germany. The sentiment
    towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is compared to a threshold value.
    Since the sentiment score is likely to be negative, the text is classified as
    "negative".


    The text contains several negative sentiments, including:


    * The mention of "violation of the laws of warfare" and "bloody" weapons

    * The description of the German armies'' tactics as "old principles of war" and
    "practised by Napoleon"

    * The mention of the "forty-four years military preparation" and the "mighty artillery"
    used by the Germans

    * The description of the war as "bloody" and the violation of the laws of warfare


    Overall, the text has a negative sentiment, and therefore, it is classified as
    "negative".'
