    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"We do not think that this method\
    \ will henceforth become a rule.Before launching this attack, the British Commander\
    \ must have been informed by his aviation, or by some other means, that the German\
    \ Front was lacking in artillery and infantry and he must very cleverly have taken\
    \ advantage of this momentary situation.Must we conclude that the rules of preparation\
    \ of attack, as stated above, will not be applied hereafter? It is very doubtful,\
    \ in view of the fact that the Germans have prepared in France too many lines\
    \ of defence, one behind the other.This English victory, however, shows that the\
    \ High Command, whenever in possession of information warranting the hope of success,\
    \ will have to combine regularly prepared attacks with surprise attacks on points\
    \ where the German effectives happen to be reduced.The success of this operation\
    \ on the Cambrai Front proves that, however strong a position may be, however\
    \ numerous its wire defences, it will always be possible to take it when not protected\
    \ by a sufficient force of artillery and infantry.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned based on the sentiment values.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "do not think" has a negative sentiment, and the token "very
    doubtful" has a negative sentiment.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified, such as the German Front, the British Commander, and the High
    Command. The sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is set above the threshold value
    (0.5), and the text is classified as "negative".


    The sentiment analysis model identifies several negative sentiments in the text,
    such as:


    * The British Commander''s attack was successful, but it was due to the German
    Front''s lack of artillery and infantry.

    * The Germans have prepared multiple lines of defense in France, making it difficult
    to take a position.

    * The success of the operation on the Cambrai Front was due to the German effectives
    being reduced.


    These negative sentiments outweigh the positive sentiments, resulting in a classification
    of "negative".'
