    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"A fortified place can only protect\
    \ the garrison and detain the enemy for a certain time. When this time has elapsed,\
    \ and the defences of the place are destroyed, the garrison should lay down its\
    \ arms. All civilized nations are agreed on this point, and there never has been\
    \ an argument except with reference to the greater or less degree of defence which\
    \ a governor is bound to make before he capitulates. At the same time, there are\
    \ generals--Villars among the number--who are of opinion that a governor should\
    \ never surrender, but that in the last extremity he should blow up the fortifications,\
    \ and take advantage of the night to cut his way through the besieging army. Where\
    \ he is unable to blow up the fortifications, he may always retire, they say,\
    \ with his garrison, and save the men.Officers who have adopted this line of conduct,\
    \ have often brought off three-fourths of their garrison.NOTE.In 1705, the French,\
    \ who were besieged in Haguenau by Count Thungen, found themselves incapable of\
    \ sustaining an assault. P\xE9ri, the governor, who had already distinguished\
    \ himself by a vigorous defence, despairing of being allowed to capitulate on\
    \ any terms short of becoming prisoner of war, resolved to abandon the place and\
    \ cut his way through the besiegers.In order to conceal his intention more effectually,\
    \ and while he deceived the enemy, to sound at the same time the disposition of\
    \ his officers, he assembled a council of war and declared his resolution to die\
    \ in the breach. Then, under pretext of the extremity to which he was reduced,\
    \ he commanded the whole garrison under arms; and leaving only a few sharpshooters\
    \ in the breach, gave the order to march, and set out in silence, under cover\
    \ of the night, from Haguenau. This audacious enterprise was crowned with success,\
    \ and P\xE9ri reached Saverne without having suffered the smallest loss.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"positive\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and each token is analyzed for sentiment.\n2. Sentiment Analysis:\
    \ The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment lexicon. The text\
    \ contains words with positive sentiment, such as \"vigor\", \"distinguished\"\
    , \"success\", and \"crowned\".\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which\
    \ each token appears is analyzed. The text describes a successful military operation,\
    \ which is generally considered a positive event.\n4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:\
    \ The aspects or entities mentioned in the text are analyzed separately. The text\
    \ describes the actions of a governor, P\xE9ri, and his garrison, which are portrayed\
    \ in a positive light.\n5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score\
    \ for the text is calculated by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens,\
    \ aspects, or entities. The positive sentiment scores outweigh the neutral or\
    \ negative sentiment scores.\n6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is\
    \ above the threshold value (0.5), so the text is classified as \"positive\".\n\
    7. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous or unclear language\
    \ that would require disambiguation or inference.\n8. Handling Outliers: The text\
    \ does not contain any extreme or outlier sentiment scores that would require\
    \ normalization or filtering.\n9. Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously\
    \ updated and refined using new data and feedback, but this is not relevant to\
    \ the classification of the input text.\n\nOverall, the text describes a successful\
    \ military operation and the actions of a governor who is portrayed in a positive\
    \ light, which leads to a classification of \"positive\"."
