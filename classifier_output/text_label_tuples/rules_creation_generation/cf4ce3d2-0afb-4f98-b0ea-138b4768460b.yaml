- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Surprises were much more common\
    \ in ancient than in modern times, for the noise of musketry and the roar of artillery,\
    \ belonging to the posts or wings assailed, will prevent any general surprise\
    \ of an army. Moreover, the division into separate masses, or _corps d'arm\xE9\
    e,_ will necessarily confine the surprise to a part, at most, of the forces employed.\
    \ Nevertheless, in the change given to military terms, a surprise may now mean\
    \ only an unexpected combination of manoeuvres for an attack, rather than an actual\
    \ falling upon troops unguarded or asleep. In this sense Marengo, Lutzen, Eylau,\
    \ &c. are numbered with surprises. Benningsen's attack on Murat at Zarantin in\
    \ 1812 was a true surprise, resulting from the gross negligence and carelessness\
    \ of the king of Naples.An _order of battle_ is the particular disposition given\
    \ to the troops for a determined manoeuvre on the field of battle. A _line of\
    \ battle_ is the general name applied to troops drawn up in their usual order\
    \ of exercise, without any determined manoeuvre; it may apply to defensive positions,\
    \ or to offensive operations, where no definitive object has been decided on.\
    \ Military writers lay down twelve orders of battle, viz.: 1st. The simple parallel\
    \ order; 2d. The parallel order with a crotchet; 3d. The parallel order reinforced\
    \ on one or both wings; 4th. The parallel order reinforced on the centre; 5th.\
    \ The simple oblique order; 6th. The oblique order reinforced on the assailing\
    \ wing; 7th. The perpendicular order on one or both wings; 8th. The concave order;\
    \ 9th. The convex order; 10th. The order by echelon on one or both wings; 11th.\
    \ The order by echelon on the centre; 12th. The combined orders of attack on the\
    \ centre and one wing at the same time.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is analyzed using a sentiment
    lexicon. The text is mostly composed of neutral words related to military tactics
    and strategies.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. The
    text is written in a formal and informative tone, with no apparent emotional tone.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are analyzed. The text discusses military tactics and strategies, with no apparent
    sentiment towards any specific aspect or entity.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens. Since the text is mostly composed
    of neutral words, the overall sentiment score is likely to be neutral.

    6. Thresholding: The threshold value for the overall sentiment score is set at
    0.5. Since the overall sentiment score is likely to be neutral, the text is classified
    as "negative" (since it''s below the threshold).


    Note that the text is written in a formal and informative tone, and there is no
    apparent emotional tone or sentiment towards any specific aspect or entity. Therefore,
    the classification as "negative" is based on the absence of positive sentiment
    rather than the presence of negative sentiment.'
