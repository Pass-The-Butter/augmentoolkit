- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The perpendicular order on one or\
    \ both wings, as seen in Figs. 10 and 11, can only be considered an arrangement\
    \ to indicate the direction along which the primary tactical movements might be\
    \ made in a battle. Two armies will never long occupy the relative perpendicular\
    \ positions indicated in these figures; for if the army B were to take its first\
    \ position on a line perpendicular to one or both extremities of the army A, the\
    \ latter would at once change the front of a portion of its line; and even the\
    \ army B, as soon as it extended itself to or beyond the extremity of A, must\
    \ of necessity turn its columns either to the right or the left, in order to bring\
    \ them near the enemy's line, and so take him in reverse, as at C, the result\
    \ being two oblique lines, as shown in Fig. 10. The inference is that one division\
    \ of the assailing army would take a position perpendicular to the enemy's wing,\
    \ whilst the remainder of the army would approach in front for the purpose of\
    \ annoying him; and this would always bring us back to one of the oblique orders\
    \ shown in Figures 9 and 16.The attack on both wings, whatever be the form of\
    \ attack adopted, may be very advantageous, but it is only admissible when the\
    \ assailant is very decidedly superior in numbers; for, if the fundamental principle\
    \ is to bring the main strength of the forces upon the decisive point, a weaker\
    \ army would violate it in directing a divided attack against a superior force.\
    \ This truth will be clearly demonstrated farther on.[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned based on the sentiment values.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. The
    text does not contain any obvious positive or negative sentiment, but it does
    contain some neutral or objective language.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified (e.g. armies, battles, tactics). The sentiment towards each aspect
    is analyzed separately.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".


    The text appears to be discussing military tactics and strategies, and the language
    used is formal and objective. There is no obvious positive or negative sentiment,
    but the text does contain some critical or cautionary language (e.g. "a weaker
    army would violate it in directing a divided attack against a superior force").
    Overall, the text is classified as "negative" due to the critical tone and the
    focus on potential weaknesses in military tactics.'
