- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"THE COMMANDER'S INFLUENCE is shown,\
    \ first in his orders for the operations, and later by the method in which he\
    \ employs the forces retained in his hand for the decisive blow. Personal control,\
    \ by the commander, of troops committed to battle, is not only impossible but\
    \ should be unnecessary, as such control and leading is the function of his subordinates,\
    \ who should be fully acquainted with his intentions and must be trusted to carry\
    \ them into execution. Other, and more important, duties have to be undertaken\
    \ by the commander, and it is essential that he should not allow his attention\
    \ to be diverted from his main object by local incidents, which are matters for\
    \ his subordinates to deal with. \"A sound system of command is based upon three\
    \ facts: an army cannot be effectively controlled by direct orders from headquarters;\
    \ the man on the spot is the best judge of the situation; intelligent co-operation\
    \ is of infinitely more value than mechanical obedience\" (\"The Science of War\"\
    ). A campaign resolves itself into a struggle between human intelligences. Each\
    \ commander will endeavour to defeat his adversary in battle, and his principal\
    \ weapon is his General Reserve. If he can exhaust the reserve power of his adversary,\
    \ while maintaining his own intact, he can proceed to victory at his own time,\
    \ and he will endeavour to exhaust the hostile reserves by causing {34} them to\
    \ be thrown in piecemeal, in ignorance of the spot where the decisive blow is\
    \ to fall. During the campaign on the Western Front in 1918 the Allies were able\
    \ to conserve their strength throughout the attacks from March 21 to July 15,\
    \ and when they passed from the guard to the thrust they extended their front\
    \ of attack from day to day, calculating correctly that this gradual extension\
    \ would mislead the enemy as to where the main blow would fall, and would cause\
    \ him to throw in his reserves piecemeal.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned to each token.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "sound" appears in a sentence with other positive tokens, so
    its sentiment score increases.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified. The sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.
    The sentiment scores of the tokens that mention each aspect or entity are aggregated.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "positive".


    The text discusses the importance of a sound system of command, the value of intelligent
    co-operation, and the ability to conserve strength during a campaign. The tone
    is informative and analytical, with no negative sentiments or criticisms. Therefore,
    the overall sentiment of the text is positive.'
