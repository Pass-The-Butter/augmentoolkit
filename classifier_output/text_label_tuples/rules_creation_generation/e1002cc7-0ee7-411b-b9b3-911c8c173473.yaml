- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Afterwards tactics attempted to\
    \ give to the mechanism of its joints the character of a general disposition,\
    \ built upon the peculiar properties of the instrument, which character leads\
    \ indeed to the battle-field, but instead of leading to the free activity of mind,\
    \ leads to an Army made like an automaton by its rigid formations and orders of\
    \ battle, which, movable only by the word of command, is intended to unwind its\
    \ activities like a piece of clockwork.4. THE REAL CONDUCT OF WAR ONLY MADE ITS\
    \ APPEARANCE INCIDENTALLY AND INCOGNITO.The conduct of War properly so called,\
    \ that is, a use of the prepared means adapted to the most special requirements,\
    \ was not considered as any suitable subject for theory, but one which should\
    \ be left to natural talents alone. By degrees, as War passed from the hand-to-hand\
    \ encounters of the middle ages into a more regular and systematic form, stray\
    \ reflections on this point also forced themselves into men's minds, but they\
    \ mostly appeared only incidentally in memoirs and narratives, and in a certain\
    \ measure incognito.5. REFLECTIONS ON MILITARY EVENTS BROUGHT ABOUT THE WANT OF\
    \ A THEORY.As contemplation on War continually increased, and its history every\
    \ day assumed more of a critical character, the urgent want appeared of the support\
    \ of fixed maxims and rules, in order that in the controversies naturally arising\
    \ about military events the war of opinions might be brought to some one point.\
    \ This whirl of opinions, which neither revolved on any central pivot nor according\
    \ to any appreciable laws, could not but be very distasteful to people's minds.6.\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned to each token.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "positive" appears in the sentence "ENDEAVOURS TO ESTABLISH
    A POSITIVE THEORY", which has a positive sentiment.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified. In this case, the aspect is "theory" and the sentiment towards
    it is positive.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by aggregating
    the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities. The sentiment score
    is positive.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "positive".

    7. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is detected in the text.

    8. Handling Outliers: No outliers are detected in the text.

    9. Continuous Improvement: The model is continuously updated and refined using
    new data and feedback.


    The text is classified as "positive" because it discusses the establishment of
    a positive theory, which is a positive sentiment.'
