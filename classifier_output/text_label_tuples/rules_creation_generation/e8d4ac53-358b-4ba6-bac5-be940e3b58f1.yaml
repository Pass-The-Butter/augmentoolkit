    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"At the end of January, 1855, the\
    \ French force was seventy-five thousand men and ten thousand horses. Up to the\
    \ same time, the English had sent fifty-four thousand men to the Crimea, but only\
