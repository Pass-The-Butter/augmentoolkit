- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"While searching after methods of\
    \ obtaining more fire when necessary, we must not forget that a column of attack\
    \ is not intended to fire, and that its fire should be reserved until the last;\
    \ for if it begins to fire while marching, the whole impulsive effect of its forward\
    \ movement is lost. Moreover, this shallower order would only be advantageous\
    \ against infantry, as the column of four divisions in three ranks--forming a\
    \ kind of solid square--would be better against cavalry. The Archduke Charles\
    \ found it advantageous at Essling, and particularly at Wagram, to adopt this\
    \ last order, which was proposed by myself in my chapter on the General Principles\
    \ of War, published in 1807. The brave cavalry of Bessi\xE8res could make no impression\
    \ upon these small masses.To give more solidity to the column proposed, the skirmishers\
    \ might, it is true, be recalled, and the fourth division reformed; but this would\
    \ be a two-rank formation, and would offer much less resistance to a charge than\
    \ the three-rank formation,--particularly on the flanks. If to remedy this inconvenience\
    \ it is proposed to form squares, many military men believe that when in two ranks\
    \ squares would not resist so well as columns. The English squares at Waterloo\
    \ were, however, only in two ranks, and, notwithstanding the heroic efforts of\
    \ the French cavalry, only one battalion was broken. I will observe, in conclusion,\
    \ that, if the two-rank formation be used for the columns of attack, it will be\
    \ difficult to preserve that in three ranks for deployed lines, as it is scarcely\
    \ possible to have two methods of formation, or, at any rate, to employ them alternately\
    \ in the same engagement. It is not probable that any European army, except the\
    \ English, will undertake to use deployed lines in two ranks. If they do, they\
    \ should never move except in columns of attack.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment scores are assigned to each token based on its
    sentiment value. The text contains words with negative sentiment like "not", "lost",
    "broken", "inconvenience", "difficult", etc.


    **Contextual Analysis**: The context in which each token appears is analyzed.
    For example, the word "not" appears in a sentence with other negative tokens,
    which increases its sentiment score.


    **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: The aspects or entities mentioned in the
    text are identified, and the sentiment towards each is analyzed separately. The
    text discusses military tactics and formations, and the sentiment is generally
    negative towards the difficulties and challenges faced by the military.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**: The overall sentiment score is calculated by aggregating
    the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities. The sentiment score
    is negative due to the presence of negative sentiment words and phrases.


    **Thresholding**: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value of
    0.5, so the text is classified as "negative".


    **Handling Ambiguity**: Techniques like sentiment disambiguation and sentiment
    inference are used to resolve ambiguity and infer the sentiment of tokens or aspects.


    **Handling Outliers**: Techniques like sentiment normalization and sentiment filtering
    are used to reduce the impact of outliers and extreme sentiment scores.


    **Continuous Improvement**: The sentiment analysis model is continuously updated
    and refined using new data and feedback.


    Overall, the text is classified as "negative" due to the presence of negative
    sentiment words and phrases, and the difficulties and challenges faced by the
    military discussed in the text.'
