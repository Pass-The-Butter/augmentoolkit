    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Napoleon's celebrated passage of\
    \ the Po, at Placentia, shows plainly how important it is for a general to possess\
    \ the means of crossing rivers. \"I felt the importance of hastening the enterprise\
    \ in order not to allow the enemy time to prevent it. But the Po, which is a river\
    \ as wide and deep as the Rhine, is a barrier difficult to be overcome. We had\
    \ no means of constructing a bridge, and were obliged to content ourselves with\
    \ the means of embarkation found at Placentia and its environs. Lannes, chief\
    \ of brigade, crossed in the first boats, with the advanced guard. The Austrians\
    \ had only ten squadrons on the other side, and these were easily overcome. The\
    \ passage was now continued without interruption, but very slowly. _If I had had\
    \ a good ponton-equipage, the fate of the enemy's army had been sealed; but the\
    \ necessity of passing the river by successive embarkations saved it.\"_In the\
    \ campaign of 1799, the Archduke attempted to pass the Aar, and attacked the French\
    \ on the opposite side, but for want of suitable equipage his operation was delayed\
    \ till the enemy had collected sufficient forces to intercept the passage; he\
    \ was now obliged to enter into a stipulation for a suspension of hostilities,\
    \ and to withdraw his bridges.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned based on the sentiment values.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "difficult" appears in a sentence with other negative tokens,
    so its sentiment score decreases.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified (e.g., Napoleon, the Po River, the Austrians, the French). The
    sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is compared to a threshold value
    (e.g., 0.5). Since the score is below the threshold, the text is classified as
    "negative".


    The text expresses a negative sentiment towards Napoleon''s military campaign,
    specifically his inability to construct a bridge and his reliance on successive
    embarkations to cross the Po River. The text also mentions the Archduke''s failed
    attempt to pass the Aar River, which adds to the negative sentiment.'
