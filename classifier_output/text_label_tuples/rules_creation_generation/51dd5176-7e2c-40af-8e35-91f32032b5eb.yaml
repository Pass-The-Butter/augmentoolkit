- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"I know that that figure 40 per cent.\
    \ looks absurdly exaggerated when it is put thus without support, but it is a\
    \ perfectly sound conclusion. If you take the lists published by Prussia, note\
    \ the dates to which they refer, the proportion of killed to the _admitted_ wounded,\
    \ and add the proportion for Bavaria, Wurtemburg, and Saxony, you find that at\
    \ this date in the late autumn two millions were affected, and Germany had not\
    \ armed more than five millions at the most at that time.Now, as in our own case,\
    \ the proportion of officers hit, wounded, and caught was large compared to that\
    \ of men; but what is more important, perhaps, the proportion of officers killed\
    \ or badly wounded was very much larger in proportion to the slightly wounded\
    \ than was the case with the men; it is fairly certain that one-half of the trained\
    \ professional officers of the German service were permanently out of action by\
    \ the end of the year.Supposing the Russian losses to be no greater than the Western\
    \ Allies (they probably are somewhat greater, from the conditions of the fighting),\
    \ or call them 30 per cent. instead of 25 per cent., and supposing the Austro-Hungarian\
    \ losses to be comparable to the German (which, from the only available sources\
    \ of statistics, they would seem to be), then we can strike a very rough estimate\
    \ of the element of wastage, and we can say that if the central figure be taken\
    \ as 9, 3.6 have gone; while of the 4 and 3 on either side (the proportionate\
    \ strength of the Allies West and East in the first phase) 1 has gone in each\
    \ case, leaving 3 and 2.It will be seen that, from this rough calculation, the\
    \ wastage of the enemy has been so much greater than our own that, if it were\
    \ absolute, his preponderance in numbers would have ceased, and the figures would\
    \ stand nearly equal.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The sentiment scores are assigned to each token based on its sentiment
    value.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. The
    text is written in a formal and objective tone, which suggests a neutral sentiment.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified, and the sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed. The
    text discusses military statistics and losses, which are presented in a neutral
    and factual manner.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities. The sentiment
    scores are neutral, and the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    6. Thresholding: The threshold value for the overall sentiment score is set at
    0.5. Since the overall sentiment score is neutral, the text is classified as "positive"
    (since it''s not negative).


    Note that the text is written in a formal and objective tone, which makes it challenging
    to classify as "negative". The text presents military statistics and losses in
    a neutral and factual manner, which suggests a neutral sentiment.'
