    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"The ultimate test of the value\
    \ of books is time. When Clausewitz died, the two books on war which were thought\
    \ the best were those of the Archduke Charles of Austria and General Jomini. To-day\
    \ the book of Clausewitz, 'On War,' easily holds the first place. It is the least\
    \ technical of all the great books on war; from beginning to end it is nothing\
    \ but common sense applied to the subject, but for that reason it is the hardest\
    \ to digest, because common sense or a man's natural instinctive judgment on any\
    \ subject is exceedingly hard to analyse and put into words. An exceptionally\
    \ gifted man can go through this process, but few can follow it for any length\
    \ of time without a distinct effort.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"positive\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using\
    \ a sentiment lexicon. The sentiment scores are:\n\t* \"The\" (neutral)\n\t* \"\
    ultimate\" (positive)\n\t* \"test\" (neutral)\n\t* ...and so on.\n3. Contextual\
    \ Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For example,\
    \ the token \"ultimate\" appears in a sentence with other positive tokens, so\
    \ its sentiment score increases.\n4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects\
    \ or entities mentioned in the text are identified (e.g., books, war, Clausewitz).\
    \ The sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.\n5. Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated by aggregating\
    \ the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n6. Thresholding:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is above the threshold value (0.5), so the text\
    \ is classified as \"positive\".\n\nThe text expresses admiration for Clausewitz's\
    \ book \"On War\" and highlights its value and relevance. The tone is informative,\
    \ analytical, and appreciative, which contributes to the overall positive sentiment."
