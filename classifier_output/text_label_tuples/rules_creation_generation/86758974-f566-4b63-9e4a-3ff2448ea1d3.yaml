    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Documents found on Germans in Champagne,\
    \ in August, furnish the following details of an attack they had prepared north\
    \ of the Souain Hill. A similar attack had been rendered impossible by the action\
    \ of the French at Verdun, and by the destruction of the gas reservoirs by the\
    \ French artillery.Three fresh divisions and fifteen companies of _stosstruppen_\
    \ (shock-troops, or special troops of assault) were to lead the attack with light\
    \ machine-guns, _minenwerfer_, signalmen, miners, sappers, gasmen, grenadiers,\
    \ stretcher-bearers, and artillery patrols. Twelve \u201Cbooty-squads\u201D and\
    \ twelve \u201Cdestruction-squads\u201D each composed of an officer and thirty-two\
    \ men were to follow the _stosstruppen_. Arrangements had been made with a view\
    \ to removing the captured guns.They had prepared for a formidable discharge of\
    \ a new gas by a six-company regiment of sappers.The gas attack was to be launched\
    \ for a quarter of an hour. A very strong artillery preparation was to follow,\
    \ after which the _stosstruppen_ were to rush forward.The aviation was to play\
    \ an important r\xF4le, and the attack was to be made with the aid of all the\
    \ means of liaison known: dispatch-runners, telephonists, optical signals, carrier-pigeons,\
    \ luminous rockets, and wireless telegraphy.[Illustration: West of AillesMay 4,\
    \ 1917--Noon]Orders had been given to bring back as many French gas-victims as\
    \ possible, with a view to studying the effects of the new product.On the 20th\
    \ of November, 1917, the third English army, by a successful surprise attack,\
    \ penetrated into the German lines to a great depth and on a large front.This\
    \ operation, prepared in the greatest secrecy, was carried out without the usual\
    \ assistance of the artillery or barrages. The infantry attacked under the protection\
    \ of numerous tanks which destroyed the wire entanglements and the most important\
    \ obstacles.\"\"\""

- content: 'I would classify the input text as "negative". Here''s my reasoning:


    1. The text describes a military attack and the preparation for it, which is a
    negative topic.

    2. The text mentions "gas attack", "gas victims", and "gas reservoirs", which
    implies a harmful and destructive event.

    3. The text also mentions "destruction-squads" and "booty-squads", which suggests
    a focus on destruction and plunder.

    4. The text does not contain any positive or uplifting language, and the tone
    is formal and objective, which suggests a focus on conveying information rather
    than expressing a positive sentiment.


    Overall, the text appears to be a factual report of a military operation, and
    the tone is neutral or negative.'
