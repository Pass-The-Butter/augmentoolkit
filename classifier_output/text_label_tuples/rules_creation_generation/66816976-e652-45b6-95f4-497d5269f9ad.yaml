    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"There is always danger that unity\
    \ of action will be sacrificed by the  continued assignment of individual tasks;\
    \ that the leader will not  be able to count with confidence on the initiative\
    \ of subordinate  leaders restoring this unity, and \u201Cthat, in the end, no\
    \ higher  commander will any longer have the assurance that his wishes will  be\
    \ carried out.\u201D The battles around Metz during August, 1870, show  a tendency\
    \ on the part of the infantry to leave behind, in reserve  and in rallying positions,\
    \ parts of the troops launched to perform a  certain combat task, \u201Cto detach\
    \ parts to maintain communication (very  often not at all endangered) with neighboring\
    \ detachments\u201D, and to  despatch others to a distance to cover a flank, or\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * The text is broken down into individual words or tokens.

    * Stop words and punctuation marks are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment lexicon.

    * The sentiment scores are assigned to each token.


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * The context in which each token appears is analyzed.

    * The sentiment scores are adjusted based on the surrounding tokens.


    **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**


    * The aspects or entities mentioned in the text are identified (e.g. unity of
    action, individual tasks, leader, subordinate leaders, higher commander, etc.).

    * The sentiment towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.


    **Sentiment Aggregation**


    * The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated by aggregating the sentiment
    scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities.

    * The sentiment scores are weighted and combined using a combination of different
    aggregation methods.


    **Thresholding**


    * The overall sentiment score is compared to a threshold value (e.g. 0.5).

    * Since the sentiment score is likely to be negative, the text is classified as
    "negative".


    **Handling Ambiguity**


    * Techniques such as sentiment disambiguation and sentiment inference are used
    to resolve ambiguity and infer the sentiment of tokens or aspects.


    **Handling Outliers**


    * Techniques such as sentiment normalization and sentiment filtering are used
    to reduce the impact of outliers and filter out extreme sentiment scores.


    **Continuous Improvement**


    * The sentiment analysis model is continuously updated and refined using new data
    and feedback.


    The text is classified as "negative" because it discusses potential dangers and
    challenges related to unity of action, leadership, and communication, which are
    likely to have a negative sentiment.'
