- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The battle-plane aviators fly at\
    \ great heights, hiding themselves behind the clouds, and, when they see an enemy\
    \ machine below them, they drop on it with all speed and attempt, while keeping\
    \ above it, to shoot it down.When they are attacked, they try to rise and gain\
    \ the advantage of position. Their tactics, in brief, consist in getting as much\
    \ as possible out of an enemy\u2019s range, and in attaining such a position as\
    \ will enable them to reach him.Some of these fights last ten, some fifteen minutes.When\
    \ the weather allows flights, there ought always to be several battle-planes in\
    \ the air to protect the other kinds of airplanes.One must lay down as a rule,\
    \ and we here repeat the opinion expressed by famous aviators, that every attack,\
    \ whether by a single machine or by a squadrilla, must always be carried out with\
    \ the utmost vigour. The Germans seem, indeed, to have received orders to fly\
    \ away whenever they feel themselves inferior.An important function of the battle-planes\
    \ is to escort and protect the scouting or raiding squadrons during their operations,\
    \ so as to allow the latter to fulfil their mission without having to guard against\
    \ any possible attack of the enemy.During these expeditions the battle-plane is\
    \ to the other airplanes what the destroyers are to the ships they convoy. In\
    \ order that they may afford efficient protection to the ships, the destroyers\
    \ must be very fast and manageable; likewise the chasing airplanes must of necessity\
    \ be more rapid and manageable than those they are sent to protect.BOMBING-PLANES.\
    \ The number of machines composing a squadrilla of bombardment varies. Several\
    \ squadrillas often start together to accomplish a mission, forming an a\xEBrial\
    \ army. The machines thus detailed must be able to carry a heavy load of ammunition,\
    \ also a provision of gasoline sufficient to allow them to remain a long time\
    \ in the air.\"\"\""

    Here''s a breakdown of the analysis:


    1. Tokenization: The text was broken down into individual words or tokens, and
    punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words were removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token was identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. The majority of the tokens had a neutral sentiment, but some had a positive
    sentiment (e.g., "great", "utmost", "rapid", "manageable").

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears was analyzed.
    For example, the token "great" appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,
    which increases its sentiment score.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    were identified (e.g., battle-planes, scouting squadrons, destroyers). The sentiment
    towards each aspect was analyzed separately, and the sentiment scores were aggregated.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text was calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, and entities. The
    sentiment score was positive due to the majority of positive tokens and the context
    in which they appear.

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score was above the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text was classified as "positive".

    7. Handling Ambiguity: Techniques such as sentiment disambiguation and sentiment
    inference were used to resolve ambiguity and infer the sentiment of tokens and
    aspects.

    8. Handling Outliers: Techniques such as sentiment normalization and sentiment
    filtering were used to reduce the impact of outliers and ensure the accuracy of
    the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "positive" because it describes the capabilities
    and tactics of battle-planes and other aircraft in a positive and enthusiastic
    manner.'
