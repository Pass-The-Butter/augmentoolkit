- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"There is always discussion as to\
    \ the lance or the saber. The lance requires skillful vigorous cavalrymen, good\
    \ horsemen, very well drilled, very adroit, for the use of the lance is more difficult\
    \ than that of the straight sword, especially if the sword is not too heavy. Is\
    \ not this an answer to the question? No matter what is done, no matter what methods\
    \ are adopted, it must always be remembered that our recruits in war time are\
    \ sent into squadrons as into battalions, with a hasty and incomplete training.\
    \ If you give them lances, most of them will just have sticks in their hands,\
    \ while a straight sword at the end of a strong arm is at the same time simple\
    \ and terrible. A short trident spear, with three short points just long enough\
    \ to kill but not only enough to go through the body, would remain in the body\
    \ of the man and carry him along. It would recoil on the cavalryman who delivered\
    \ the blow, he would be upset by the blow himself. But the dragoon must be supported\
    \ by the saddle, and as he had kept hold of the shaft he would be able to disengage\
    \ the fork which had pierced the body some six inches. No cavalry of equal morale\
    \ could stand against a cavalry armed with such forked spears.As between forks\
    \ and lances, the fork would replace the lance. That is, of course, for beginners\
    \ in mounted fencing. But the fork! It would be ridiculous, not military!With\
    \ the lance one always figures without the horse, whose slightest movement diverts\
    \ the lance so much. The lance is a weapon frightful even to the mounted man who\
    \ uses it properly. If he sticks an enemy at the gallop, he is dismounted, torn\
    \ off by the arm attached to the lance which remains in the body of his enemy.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is broken down into individual words or tokens. Stop
    words like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each token is identified using a sentiment
    lexicon. Some tokens have positive sentiment (e.g. "skillful", "adroit"), while
    others have negative sentiment (e.g. "hasty", "incomplete").

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context in which each token appears is analyzed. For
    example, the token "hasty" appears in a sentence with other negative tokens, which
    increases its negative sentiment score.

    4. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis: The aspects or entities mentioned in the text
    are identified (e.g. "lance", "saber", "cavalrymen"). The sentiment towards each
    aspect is analyzed separately.

    5. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by aggregating the sentiment scores of the tokens, aspects, or entities. The sentiment
    score is likely to be negative due to the presence of negative tokens and the
    criticism of certain aspects (e.g. the lance).

    6. Thresholding: The overall sentiment score is below the threshold value (0.5),
    so the text is classified as "negative".


    Note that the text is a discussion about the pros and cons of different weapons,
    and while some points are made in favor of the lance, the overall tone is critical
    and negative.'
