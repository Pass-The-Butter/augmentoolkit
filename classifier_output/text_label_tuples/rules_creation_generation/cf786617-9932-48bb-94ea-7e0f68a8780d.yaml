    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"An isolated wall, only two or three\
    \ feet thick, may readily be demolished by exploding one or two casks of powder\
    \ placed in contact with its base. If the wall be five or six feet thick, the\
    \ charges should be placed under the foundation. For walls of still greater thickness\
    \ it will be best to open a gallery to the centre of the wall, a foot or two above\
    \ its base, and place the powder in chambers thus excavated. Revetment walls may\
    \ be overturned by placing the charges at the back of the wall, about one-third\
    \ or one-quarter of the way up from the base. If placed too near the base, a breach\
    \ will be made in the wall without overturning it.To demolish a bridge of masonry\
    \ the powder should be lodged in chambers excavated in the centre of the piers.\
    \ When there is not time for excavating these chambers in the piers, a trench\
    \ may be cut over the key of the arch, in which the powder is placed and exploded;\
    \ or, the casks of powder may be suspended immediately under the arch, with the\
    \ same results. Where a saving of powder is of consequence, small chambers may\
    \ be excavated in the haunches of the arch, and the mine carefully _tamped_ before\
    \ firing it.Bridges of wood may be destroyed by suspending casks of powder under\
    \ the principal timbers, or attaching them to the supports.Palisading, gates,\
    \ doors, &c., may be destroyed in the same way, by suspending casks or bags of\
    \ powder against their sides; or still more effectually, by burying the charges\
    \ just beneath their base.\"\"\""

- content: 'I would classify the input text as "negative". Here''s my reasoning:


    1. The text describes methods for demolishing or destroying various structures,
    such as walls, bridges, palisading, gates, and doors. This implies a negative
    sentiment towards these structures.

    2. The text uses words with negative connotations, such as "demolish", "destroy",
    "breach", and "overturn". These words contribute to the overall negative sentiment
    of the text.

    3. The text does not contain any positive words or phrases that could counterbalance
    the negative sentiment.


    Overall, the text has a strong negative tone, suggesting that it is intended to
    convey a sense of destruction or demolition, rather than a positive sentiment.'
