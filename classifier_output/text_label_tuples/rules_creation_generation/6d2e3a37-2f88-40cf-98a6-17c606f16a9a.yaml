    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Break down the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation\
    \ marks, special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ Identify the sentiment of each token using a sentiment lexicon (a list of words\
    \ with their corresponding sentiment values, e.g. positive, negative, neutral).\n\
    * Assign a sentiment score to each token based on its sentiment value.\n\n**Rule\
    \ 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Analyze the context in which each token appears.\
    \ For example:\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with other positive tokens,\
    \ its sentiment score may increase.\n\t+ If a token appears in a sentence with\
    \ other negative tokens, its sentiment score may decrease.\n\t+ If a token appears\
    \ in a sentence with a negation word (e.g. \"not\", \"never\"), its sentiment\
    \ score may be inverted.\n\n**Rule 4: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Identify\
    \ the aspects or entities mentioned in the text (e.g. products, services, people).\n\
    * Analyze the sentiment towards each aspect or entity separately.\n* Assign a\
    \ sentiment score to each aspect or entity based on the sentiment scores of the\
    \ tokens that mention it.\n\n**Rule 5: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* Calculate\
    \ the overall sentiment score for the text by aggregating the sentiment scores\
    \ of the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* Use a weighted average or a combination\
    \ of different aggregation methods (e.g. sum, product) to combine the sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\n**Rule 6: Thresholding**\n\n* Set a threshold value for the overall\
    \ sentiment score (e.g. 0.5).\n* Classify the text as \"positive\" if the overall\
    \ sentiment score is above the threshold, and \"negative\" if it's below the threshold.\n\
    \n**Rule 7: Handling Ambiguity**\n\n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment disambiguation:\
    \ resolve ambiguity by considering the context and the sentiment of surrounding\
    \ tokens.\n\t+ Sentiment inference: infer the sentiment of a token or aspect based\
    \ on the sentiment of other tokens or aspects.\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Outliers**\n\
    \n* Use techniques such as:\n\t+ Sentiment normalization: normalize the sentiment\
    \ scores to reduce the impact of outliers.\n\t+ Sentiment filtering: filter out\
    \ extreme sentiment scores that may be due to noise or errors.\n\n**Rule 9: Continuous\
    \ Improvement**\n\n* Continuously update and refine the sentiment analysis model\
    \ using new data and feedback.\n* Monitor the performance of the model and adjust\
    \ the rules and parameters as needed.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can develop\
    \ a robust sentiment analysis model that accurately classifies text as \"positive\"\
    \ or \"negative\".\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"To break off the action by systematically\
    \ relieving the troops engaged with the enemy,[480] is only possible if the force\
    \ still has reserves available, if cavalry and artillery are in a position to\
    \ take a hand in the fight, or if the troops that have been withdrawn are sheltered\
    \ from the enemy\u2019s fire by features of the ground--all of which depends in\
    \ many cases on chance.[480] _Taktik_, V, p. 344.It is much more difficult to\
    \ break off an action in defense than in attack, as in the former case, the assailant\
    \ approaches closer with every moment. This brings up the question, as to whether\
    \ it would not be better for the defender to hold out until darkness sets in than\
    \ expose his troops to the incalculable results of a retreat under fire. When\
    \ the assailant has once entered the zone of short ranges, the defender will no\
    \ longer be able to effect a systematic retreat. If the defender has used up all\
    \ his reserves, the withdrawal should be begun at the point where the enemy is\
    \ not pressing his attack, or where he has been unable to gain a superiority of\
    \ fire. When a withdrawal is made, the whole local front should retire at once\
    \ and simultaneously; it would be a mistake to reduce gradually the strength of\
    \ the units engaged, for this would only give the enemy an opportunity to annihilate\
    \ completely the remaining parts. If a company cannot maintain its position, a\
    \ platoon certainly could not do so.[Illustration]\"\"\""

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* The text is broken down into\
    \ individual words or tokens.\n* Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words are removed.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* The sentiment of each token\
    \ is identified using a sentiment lexicon.\n* Tokens with negative sentiment values\
    \ are:\n\t+ \"relieving\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"enemy\" (negative)\n\t+ \"difficult\"\
    \ (negative)\n\t+ \"incalculable\" (negative)\n\t+ \"annihilate\" (negative)\n\
    * Tokens with positive sentiment values are:\n\t+ \"reserves\" (neutral)\n\t+\
    \ \"cavalry\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"artillery\" (neutral)\n\t+ \"features\" (neutral)\n\
    * The overall sentiment score is negative due to the prevalence of negative sentiment\
    \ tokens.\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\n* The context in which each token appears\
    \ is analyzed.\n* The text discusses the difficulties of breaking off an action\
    \ in defense, which is a negative topic.\n* The use of words like \"enemy\", \"\
    difficult\", and \"annihilate\" reinforces the negative sentiment.\n\n**Aspect-Based\
    \ Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* The aspects or entities mentioned in the text are:\n\
    \t+ Troops\n\t+ Enemy\n\t+ Reserves\n\t+ Cavalry\n\t+ Artillery\n* The sentiment\
    \ towards each aspect or entity is analyzed separately.\n* The overall sentiment\
    \ towards the troops is negative, as they are discussed in the context of being\
    \ attacked and potentially annihilated.\n* The sentiment towards the enemy is\
    \ negative, as they are the aggressors.\n\n**Sentiment Aggregation**\n\n* The\
    \ overall sentiment score is calculated by aggregating the sentiment scores of\
    \ the tokens, aspects, or entities.\n* The sentiment score is negative due to\
    \ the prevalence of negative sentiment tokens and the negative sentiment towards\
    \ the troops and enemy.\n\n**Thresholding**\n\n* The overall sentiment score is\
    \ below the threshold value of 0.5, which is set for classifying the text as \"\
    negative\".\n\nTherefore, based on the rules provided, I classify the input text\
    \ as \"negative\"."
