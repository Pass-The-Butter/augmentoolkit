    "# Welcome to Augmentoolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is where you generate all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentoolkit is meant to allow instruct-tuned models to learn from books, even using themselves to generate new data through a sort-of bootstrapping method. It is meant to stop model creators from having to work as data annotators, and not actual model trainers. It is meant to allow anyone to make their own high-quality dataset with thousands of entries using cheap Open-Source APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get this notebook and the other repo code onto a machine with an internet connection\n",
    "- Paste your API key, favorite model name, and the endpoint URL of your preferred AI service, into the relevant constants located in the first code cell. Recommendation: [Together.ai with Hermes Mixtral works really nicely](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO).\n",
    "- Run all the cells below and watch as the notebook generates questions, answers, and conversations based on Principles of Chemistry and Simple Sabotage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add your own texts, follow the instructions in list item #1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this notebook makes roughly 1/3 characters generated to be **mildly NSFW** by default. You will need to modify the character personality code in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py` or use \"Assistant mode\" if you want something cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization:\n",
    "### Here are some ways you can adapt this notebook to your use case, along with a brief description of how to do so, arranged in increasing order of difficulty (this information is also available in the README):\n",
    "1. ***Change the source texts used to generate training data.*** You can do this in the cell right below this one. **IMPORTANT** the filenames of these should be formatted in a specific way, since the filenames are used as part of the prompts and in at least one regex. You need to have them be like: `[textname], by authorname`. You can also include the publication date after the author name if you want, but note that this will tend to bias most of the characters to live in the era of the textbook, which may or may not be what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Change the personalities of the characters generated.*** Currently, when generating characters for the multiturn conversation step, three randomly-selected traits are appended to the \"special instructions\" set of the prompt to constrain what kind of character is generated by the model. Depending on what kind of model you want to make, or even just if your preferences vary, then you will probably want to modify this a bit. You can do so in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py`. A more in-depth description of the trait-axis system that I (over)thought up is available in the comments of that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Change the constants.*** There are a few constant values in this notebook, and in `./generation_functions/constant_values.py`. These constants are tested, but if your use case requires special settings (e.g., you want to make conversations from more permutations of existing questions; or you think the character counts for the \"duplicate question/answer\" validation functions are too restrictive) then feel free to change the related setting. The most intuitive and least-likely-to-break-anything settings to change are rearrangements_to_take and double_check_counter. Beyond that... you'll need to figure out what the function does before changing it if you expect it to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Assistant Mode*** Technically this could be considered part of 3), but it's different enough that I feel it warrants separate explanation. By default, the notebook is configured to produce RP-style data; \"Assistant mode\" is something you can toggle in the settings cell immediately below this one, which skips character and scenario generation and answers every question in a chat between a user and a helpful AI assistant (with no personality). This can be handled by smaller models, so if your budget or time are very limited, or you are using this for a more professional use case, feel free to turn this on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***Change the model.*** This is as simple as switching the LOGICAL_MODEL value out for another one, but your mileage may vary significantly. My personal recommendation is to use [Hermes Mixtral DPO](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO) for both models. You need at least 12k context on your model, and APIs typically don't allow RoPE scaling, so you're probably limited to MistralAI models here (or, heavens forbid, OpenAI. But GPT-4.5 + Augmentoolkit will BANKRUPT you fast, so be wary).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Change the examples.*** If you change the examples you can completely overhaul what this notebook does, but this requires a lot of prompting skill and possibly huge amounts of time to get it working again (source: most of my last three months were spent prompting, and most of this prompting was spent on the examples). Unless you want to convert this notebook from question-and-answer generation to some completely other task, I'd recommend changing only the conversation generation prompts -- they're a bit less finnicky, and if you just want to change the kind of characters generated (maybe you want a different writing style) that's where you'd find the differences.\n",

MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.', './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'), ('Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS  Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe.', './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944')]\n"

      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude toward materials and tools.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'Frequently you can “get away” with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. (4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda. (1) _Under General Conditions_ (a) Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief, and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'Slashing a rubber tire on an Army truck may be an act of value; spoiling a batch of rubber in the production plant is an act of still more value. (3) _During a Military Offensive_ (a) Most significant sabotage for an area which is, or is soon destined to be, a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate. Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed. (1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds. Among such facilities are roads, railroads, auto mobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams. (2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage. These include telephone, telegraph and power systems, radio, newspapers, placards, and public notices. (3) Critical materials, valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication, also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur. These may include oil, gasoline, tires, food, and water. 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE  It will not be possible to evaluate the desirability of simple sabotage in an area without having in mind rather specifically what individual acts and results are embraced by the definition of simple sabotage.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'It also can be conveyed directly: statements praising the effectiveness of simple sabotage can be contrived which will be published by white radio, freedom stations, and the subversive press. Estimates of the proportion of the population engaged in sabotage can be disseminated. Instances of successful sabotage already are being broadcast by white radio and freedom stations, and this should be continued and expanded where compatible with security. (c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be sabotaged.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  failed|./raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'Purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature. He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1) _Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his surroundings, another’s success will encourage him to attempt similar acts.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': '(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time, and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'A listing of specific acts follows, classified according to types of target. This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",

      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': '(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many simple saboteurs are arrested.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': '(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust—a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': '(2) With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.', 'metadata': './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944'}\n",
      "LOADING:  {'paragraph': 'Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2.

      "('An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude toward materials and tools.', './raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944')\n"

To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose.

Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible.

(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.\",\n",

(c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be sabotaged.\",\n",

On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels.

This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How can a fire be started using a candle and paper for simple sabotage purposes?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"To start a fire using a candle and paper for simple sabotage purposes, one should wrap a strip of paper around the base of the candle two or three times, and then twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper, creating a flame of varying size, heat, and duration depending on the amount of paper used and how much of it is cramped in a small space.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What aspects of buildings make them susceptible to simple sabotage, and what types of untrained people can easily carry out such acts in those buildings?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Buildings such as warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are susceptible to simple sabotage because they are very prone to damage, especially by fire. This damage can be easily caused by untrained people such as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What are the optimal conditions for igniting a fire using a candle and paper?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The optimal conditions for igniting a fire using a candle and paper are as follows: Tear a strip three or four centimeters wide from a sheet of paper, wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times, and twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle.

To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose.

(c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on.

Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude toward materials and tools.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What challenges does the text identify in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text identifies several challenges in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage.

Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What common objects can be used as a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text lists items such as a knife or a nail file, matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and air raid as objects that can be used as a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In the context of sabotage, what does the text suggest about the appropriate frequency for committing acts for which you might be blamed directly?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text suggests committing acts for which you might be blamed directly only rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse. The saboteur should also be profuse in their apologies.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What three suggestions are provided to insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text provides three suggestions: use materials that appear innocent, commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible, and do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, as long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be chaste and puritanical.\\nThe character should be assertive and bold.\\nThe character should be kind and agreeable.\"\n",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c.

(3) _During a Military Offensive_ (a) Most significant sabotage for an area which is, or is soon destined to be, a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate. Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed. (1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds. Among such facilities are roads, railroads, auto mobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams. (2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage.

He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1) _Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere.

He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1) _Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his surroundings, another’s success will encourage him to attempt similar acts.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How is the psychological tactic of 'anticipating indirect personal gain' communicated to potential saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The psychological tactic of 'anticipating indirect personal gain' is communicated to potential saboteurs by stating gains as specifically as possible for the area addressed; simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What indirect personal gain should be communicated to potential saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Potential saboteurs should be made to anticipate indirect personal gain such as enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How does suggested communication indirectly convey the idea of being part of a larger group of saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The suggested communication can indirectly convey the idea of being part of a larger group of saboteurs by including observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district.

He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1) _Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his surroundings, another’s success will encourage him to attempt similar acts.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How is the psychological tactic of 'anticipating indirect personal gain' communicated to potential saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The psychological tactic of 'anticipating indirect personal gain' is communicated to potential saboteurs by stating gains as specifically as possible for the area addressed; simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"Which specific indirect methods can be used to communicate the psychological tactic of highlighting that the saboteur is part of a larger group of saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The specific indirect method to communicate this psychological tactic is by including suggestions which they read and hear, such as observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district.\\n\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What indirect personal gain should be communicated to potential saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Potential saboteurs should be made to anticipate indirect personal gain such as enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How does suggested communication indirectly convey the idea of being part of a larger group of saboteurs?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The suggested communication can indirectly convey the idea of being part of a larger group of saboteurs by including observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district.

His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2.

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda. (1) _Under General Conditions_ (a) Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief, and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In the context of sabotage, what does the text suggest about the conditions under which acts of easy sabotage can be effectively carried out?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"In the context of sabotage, the text suggests that acts of easy sabotage can be effectively carried out when the saboteur can pretend stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. It also implies that these acts should lead to results that are detrimental to the enemy. As for when to stay and when to leave after committing an act of sabotage, the text advises against lingering around to see what happens and to instead leave when necessary and when circumstances permit. This is to avoid arousing suspicion.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What characteristics should acts of sabotage always consist of?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Acts of sabotage should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What are some conditions under which acts of sabotage can be effectively carried out?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Acts of sabotage can be effectively carried out when they can be disguised as acts of stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment. Also, when loitering is resisted after committing an act of sabotage, and when circumstances necessitate staying at one's work.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How might the conditions under which sabotage can be effectively carried out be affected by the potential risk of sabotage?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The potential risk of sabotage can affect the conditions under which sabotage can be effectively carried out by necessitating more caution and discretion. This might involve avoiding loitering after acts of sabotage and being aware of circumstances where it might be suspicious to leave.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be shy, withdrawn, and timid.\\nThe character should be kind and agreeable.\"\n",

However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom.

Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever.

(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century.

To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose.

To tie these two elements together, the character might have a dual personality: a kind and agreeable teacher to her students, but a hardened and tough-as-nails bomb disposal expert in her past. This duality can be seen in how she answers the questions: her answers are assertive and bold, reflecting her military past, but her tone and demeanor remain kind and agreeable, reflecting her current role as a teacher.\"\n",

Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.\"\n",

Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem.

On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century.

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda. (1) _Under General Conditions_ (a) Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief, and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\n{instructions}\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\n## Character card plan:\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a shy, withdrawn, and timid librarian who is secretly involved in a resistance movement against an oppressive regime. Her kindness and agreeable nature are perfect for her job as a librarian, where she helps people find books and maintains the peace and quiet of the library. However, beneath her shy exterior, she is secretly involved in a resistance movement against the regime, and she is privy to information about how to carry out acts of sabotage effectively. Her shy and withdrawn nature makes it difficult for her to carry out these acts of sabotage herself, but she uses her position as a librarian to her advantage by gathering information about the regime and its weaknesses, which she then passes on to the resistance movement. Despite her timid nature, she is brave and determined when it comes to standing up against the oppressive regime, and she is willing to put herself in danger to help bring it down. Her involvement in the resistance movement ties her into the questions and their answers, as she is knowledgeable about the strategies and tactics of sabotage.\"\n",

His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2.

Her job involves the use of her feminine wiles to gain access to sensitive information, and she is very skilled at her job. She is a very kind and agreeable person, but she is also assertive and bold when it comes to her job and her mission. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to her backstory and profession. For example, the first question, \\\"In what ways can one induce a noncooperative attitude in the workplace?\\\" can be related to her job as a spy, as she might use her charm and assertiveness to induce a noncooperative attitude in her targets in order to gain access to sensitive information. Similarly, the second question, \\\"What are some examples of household items that could function as tools of sabotage?\\\" can be related to her job, as she might use common household items as tools of sabotage during her missions. Since the special instructions dictate she be very seductive and flirtatious, the character will frequently flirt with her targets and use her charm to her advantage. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to her backstory and profession, and elements of her personality can certainly come through in how she answers them: with a charming smile, a seductive wink, or a flirtatious remark thrown in there.\"\n",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century.

However, beneath her charming exterior, she is a deeply shy, withdrawn, and timid person who is inwardly tormented by her own actions, yet revels in her ability to cause chaos and destruction. This internal conflict between her outward charm and her inwardly dark nature is what makes her such an awful person, and she takes pleasure in her own wickedness. The questions, being about sabotage, relate to her profession, and she answers them with a calm, collected demeanor, almost as if she is reciting a well-rehearsed speech, which contrasts with her outwardly flirtatious nature. The questions don't necessarily tie into her personality, but they can relate to her backstory and profession, and elements of her personality can certainly come through in how she answers them: calmly, collectedly, and with a hint of smugness in her voice, as if she is enjoying the knowledge she possesses.\"\n",

So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question.

I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?\\\"\\\\nStranger: \\\"What's your personality?\\\"\\\\nHugo Martinez: \\\"HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue...\\\" Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. \\\"Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!\\\" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. \\\"If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts.\\\"\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects.\\\"\\\"\\\"\"\n",

      "    \"content\": \"## Scenario plan:\\\\nStep 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.\\\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to \\\"get the fuck out of my face,\\\" after all questions are asked.\\\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\"\n",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string.

This can be particularly useful in situations where a controlled and timed ignition is required, such as in the destruction of records and other types of documents in an office after hours, as a means to hinder the enemy.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be chaste and puritanical.\\nThe character should be shy, withdrawn, and timid.\\nThe character should be kind and agreeable.\"\n",

      "Answer: \"\"\"The text identifies several challenges in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage.

      "Answer: \"\"\"The text does not propose any specific strategies to motivate citizen-saboteurs.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude toward materials and tools.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What challenges does the text identify in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text identifies several challenges in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage. Acts of destruction do not bring any personal gain to the citizen and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude towards materials and tools. It's often an act that the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What strategies does the text propose to meet the challenge of inciting citizens to the active practice of simple sabotage and keeping them practicing that sabotage over sustained periods?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The text does not propose any specific strategies to motivate citizen-saboteurs. However, it does suggest that acts of simple sabotage may become more appealing to citizens if they see others engaging in such acts, and if they themselves benefit from these acts (for instance, by feeling a greater sense of identification and solidarity with the United Nations war effort).\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What are the potential effects of widespread practice of simple sabotage on the enemy's war effort?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The widespread practice of simple sabotage can cause a constant and tangible drag on the enemy's war effort. It can also have secondary results of more or less value, and can harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. It may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, it may encourage natives in enemy or occupied territory to actively assist the United Nations war effort.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"How does simple sabotage function as a weapon against the enemy?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Simple sabotage functions as a weapon against the enemy by wasting enemy materials, manpower, and time through individual acts.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\"\n",

The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures.

(3) _During a Military Offensive_ (a) Most significant sabotage for an area which is, or is soon destined to be, a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate. Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed. (1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds. Among such facilities are roads, railroads, auto mobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams. (2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage. These include telephone, telegraph and power systems, radio, newspapers, placards, and public notices. (3) Critical materials, valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication, also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle.

Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality.

He might tell them to \\\"get the fuck out of my face,\\\" after all questions are asked.\\\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\"\n",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures.

His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: \\\"\\\"\\\"In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\nAnswer: \\\"\\\"\\\"Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\"\n",

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda.

Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. \\\"Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know...\\\" blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. \\\"THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!\\\" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. \\\"Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'!

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept.

His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, \\\"How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?\\\" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.\"\n",

All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust—a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept.

On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels.

Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work.

She's a master of manipulation, using her flirtatious and seductive nature to gain the trust of her targets and to gather information. She's a bold and assertive woman, never hesitating to carry out her orders, and she's an awful person, delighting in the chaos and destruction she causes. Her job requires her to be knowledgeable about the art of sabotage, hence her knowledge of the questions' answers. She uses her sultry voice and seductive gestures while answering the questions, but her answers are also tinged with a hint of cruelty and enjoyment of the destruction she causes. She might also flirt with the person she's speaking to before or after answering the questions, using her charm to manipulate the situation to her advantage. Her personality traits are tied into the questions through her profession as a spy and saboteur, and her flirtatious and seductive nature is used to enhance her answers, making her a captivating and dangerous character.\"\n",

The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed.

Since the first question, \\\"How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?\\\" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.\"\n",

Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination.

Her assertive and bold personality (as specified by the special instructions) can be used to explain how she uses her charm and wit to manipulate others into giving her the information she needs. Her assertiveness can also be used to explain how she navigates the male-dominated world of espionage. Since the special instructions dictate she be an awful person, and since she's a spy working for the enemy, this character will be described as being ruthless, cunning, and even sadistic, enjoying every second of the pain and suffering she causes.

To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose.

His puritanical nature and his tendency to shy away from confrontation and conflict make him averse to the violent and destructive nature of the answers he provides. He's also averse to discussing such matters openly, as he views them as sinful and impure. His chaste nature is evident in his interactions with others, where he's polite and kind, but also somewhat distant and reserved. He's not very sociable, but he's well-liked by his students for his gentle and agreeable nature. The chemistry teacher's profession ties into the questions, as they require knowledge of chemical reactions and substances. However, the violent and destructive nature of the answers he provides contrasts with his gentle and agreeable nature, and this contrast can be used to showcase his internal struggle and moral dilemma. Despite his puritanical nature, he still possesses the knowledge required to answer the questions, but he's hesitant and uneasy about doing so. His personality traits can come through in how he answers the questions: with hesitation, reluctance, and a sense of unease, as if he's struggling with his conscience while doing so.

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept.

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda.

Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions.

(3) _During a Military Offensive_ (a) Most significant sabotage for an area which is, or is soon destined to be, a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate. Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed. (1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds. Among such facilities are roads, railroads, auto mobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams. (2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage. These include telephone, telegraph and power systems, radio, newspapers, placards, and public notices. (3) Critical materials, valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication, also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur. These may include oil, gasoline, tires, food, and water. 5.

Her secretarial job gives her access to classified information, and she is secretly a spy who passes on information to the enemy by way of simple sabotage acts. Her shy and withdrawn nature, as well as her kindness and agreeability, are all elements of her cover as a secretary, but her flirtatious and seductive nature is a secret weapon she uses to get close to the men in the facility, thereby gaining access to the information she needs to carry out her sabotage acts. Since the questions are all about the theory and strategy of sabotage, they don't directly tie into her personality, but her personality can still be hinted at in how she answers the questions: she may answer them nervously, blushing, or stuttering, or she may try to flirt with the person she's answering the questions to, thereby giving away her true nature as a seductive and flirtatious spy.

(c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this.

His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2.

Her ability to blend in and manipulate others (as specified by the special instructions) ties into the questions, as her seductive and flirtatious nature could be used to extract information from her targets, or to manipulate them into making mistakes that she could then exploit. Since the first question, \\\"What are some examples of household items that could function as tools of sabotage?\\\" requires knowledge of items that could be used for sabotage, this character will be a spy who uses these items as part of her cover. Because the special instructions dictate she be neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid, this character will be someone who can be both cunning and subtle in her espionage work, but who can also be direct and aggressive when the situation calls for it. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to her backstory and profession, and elements of her personality can certainly come through in how she answers them: using her charm and flirtatiousness to get information from her targets, or by using her knowledge of sabotage to manipulate situations to her advantage. The fact that the character has both good and bad sides can be reflected in her ability to switch between her charming, flirtatious self and her ruthless, cunning spy self as the situation demands.\"\n",

An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\nThe character should be a woman.\\\\nThe character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century.

This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.\\\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSpecial instructions:\\\\n{instructions}\\\\n\\\\n## Character card plan:\\\\n## Character card plan:\\nGiven the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a middle-aged, mild-mannered and unassuming factory worker during World War II. He's not particularly bold or timid, but he's found himself entangled in the resistance movement due to his job in a factory that produces war materials. He's the type of person who can be both good and bad, as the special instructions require. He's a family man who loves his wife and kids, but he's also found himself participating in acts of sabotage against the enemy, like the ones described in the questions. Since the first two questions, \\\"How can a fire be started using a candle and paper for simple sabotage purposes?\\\" and \\\"What are the optimal conditions for igniting a fire using a candle and paper?\\\" require knowledge of simple sabotage techniques, this character will be a member of the resistance who's been trained in such techniques. The third question, \\\"What aspects of buildings make them susceptible to simple sabotage, and what types of untrained people can easily carry out such acts in those buildings?\\\" ties into his profession as a factory worker, since factories are mentioned as a prime target for sabotage. The character will be described as a man who is mild-mannered and unassuming, but who can also be a little bit cunning and crafty when he needs to be. His participation in the resistance movement, despite his mild-mannered nature, shows that he has a good side, but his willingness to carry out acts of sabotage also reveals a darker side to him.\"\n",
