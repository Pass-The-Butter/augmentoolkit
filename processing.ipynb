    "# Welcome to Augmentoolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is where you generate all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentoolkit is meant to allow instruct-tuned models to learn from books, even using themselves to generate new data through a sort-of bootstrapping method. It is meant to stop model creators from having to work as data annotators, and not actual model trainers. It is meant to allow anyone to make their own high-quality dataset with thousands of entries using cheap Open-Source APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get this notebook and the other repo code onto a machine with an internet connection\n",
    "- Paste your API key, favorite model name, and the endpoint URL of your preferred AI service, into the relevant constants located in the first code cell. Recommendation: [Together.ai with Hermes Mixtral works really nicely](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO).\n",
    "- Run all the cells below and watch as the notebook generates questions, answers, and conversations based on Principles of Chemistry and Simple Sabotage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add your own texts, follow the instructions in list item #1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this notebook makes roughly 1/3 characters generated to be **mildly NSFW** by default. You will need to modify the character personality code in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py` or use \"Assistant mode\" if you want something cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization:\n",
    "### Here are some ways you can adapt this notebook to your use case, along with a brief description of how to do so, arranged in increasing order of difficulty (this information is also available in the README):\n",
    "1. ***Change the source texts used to generate training data.*** You can do this in the cell right below this one. **IMPORTANT** the filenames of these should be formatted in a specific way, since the filenames are used as part of the prompts and in at least one regex. You need to have them be like: `[textname], by authorname`. You can also include the publication date after the author name if you want, but note that this will tend to bias most of the characters to live in the era of the textbook, which may or may not be what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Change the personalities of the characters generated.*** Currently, when generating characters for the multiturn conversation step, three randomly-selected traits are appended to the \"special instructions\" set of the prompt to constrain what kind of character is generated by the model. Depending on what kind of model you want to make, or even just if your preferences vary, then you will probably want to modify this a bit. You can do so in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py`. A more in-depth description of the trait-axis system that I (over)thought up is available in the comments of that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Change the constants.*** There are a few constant values in this notebook, and in `./generation_functions/constant_values.py`. These constants are tested, but if your use case requires special settings (e.g., you want to make conversations from more permutations of existing questions; or you think the character counts for the \"duplicate question/answer\" validation functions are too restrictive) then feel free to change the related setting. The most intuitive and least-likely-to-break-anything settings to change are rearrangements_to_take and double_check_counter. Beyond that... you'll need to figure out what the function does before changing it if you expect it to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Assistant Mode*** Technically this could be considered part of 3), but it's different enough that I feel it warrants separate explanation. By default, the notebook is configured to produce RP-style data; \"Assistant mode\" is something you can toggle in the settings cell immediately below this one, which skips character and scenario generation and answers every question in a chat between a user and a helpful AI assistant (with no personality). This can be handled by smaller models, so if your budget or time are very limited, or you are using this for a more professional use case, feel free to turn this on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***Change the model.*** This is as simple as switching the LOGICAL_MODEL value out for another one, but your mileage may vary significantly. My personal recommendation is to use [Hermes Mixtral DPO](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO) for both models. You need at least 12k context on your model, and APIs typically don't allow RoPE scaling, so you're probably limited to MistralAI models here (or, heavens forbid, OpenAI. But GPT-4.5 + Augmentoolkit will BANKRUPT you fast, so be wary).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Change the examples.*** If you change the examples you can completely overhaul what this notebook does, but this requires a lot of prompting skill and possibly huge amounts of time to get it working again (source: most of my last three months were spent prompting, and most of this prompting was spent on the examples). Unless you want to convert this notebook from question-and-answer generation to some completely other task, I'd recommend changing only the conversation generation prompts -- they're a bit less finnicky, and if you just want to change the kind of characters generated (maybe you want a different writing style) that's where you'd find the differences.\n",
