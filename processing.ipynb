    "# Welcome to Augmentoolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is where you generate all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Augmentoolkit is meant to allow instruct-tuned models to learn from books, even using themselves to generate new data through a sort-of bootstrapping method. It is meant to stop model creators from having to work as data annotators, and not actual model trainers. It is meant to allow anyone to make their own high-quality dataset with thousands of entries using cheap Open-Source APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quickstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get this notebook and the other repo code onto a machine with an internet connection\n",
    "- Paste your API key, favorite model name, and the endpoint URL of your preferred AI service, into the relevant constants located in the first code cell. Recommendation: [Together.ai with Hermes Mixtral works really nicely](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO).\n",
    "- Run all the cells below and watch as the notebook generates questions, answers, and conversations based on Principles of Chemistry and Simple Sabotage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add your own texts, follow the instructions in list item #1 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this notebook makes roughly 1/3 characters generated to be **mildly NSFW** by default. You will need to modify the character personality code in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py` or use \"Assistant mode\" if you want something cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization:\n",
    "### Here are some ways you can adapt this notebook to your use case, along with a brief description of how to do so, arranged in increasing order of difficulty (this information is also available in the README):\n",
    "1. ***Change the source texts used to generate training data.*** You can do this in the cell right below this one. **IMPORTANT** the filenames of these should be formatted in a specific way, since the filenames are used as part of the prompts and in at least one regex. You need to have them be like: `[textname], by authorname`. You can also include the publication date after the author name if you want, but note that this will tend to bias most of the characters to live in the era of the textbook, which may or may not be what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Change the personalities of the characters generated.*** Currently, when generating characters for the multiturn conversation step, three randomly-selected traits are appended to the \"special instructions\" set of the prompt to constrain what kind of character is generated by the model. Depending on what kind of model you want to make, or even just if your preferences vary, then you will probably want to modify this a bit. You can do so in `./generation_functions/special_instructions.py`. A more in-depth description of the trait-axis system that I (over)thought up is available in the comments of that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Change the constants.*** There are a few constant values in this notebook, and in `./generation_functions/constant_values.py`. These constants are tested, but if your use case requires special settings (e.g., you want to make conversations from more permutations of existing questions; or you think the character counts for the \"duplicate question/answer\" validation functions are too restrictive) then feel free to change the related setting. The most intuitive and least-likely-to-break-anything settings to change are rearrangements_to_take and double_check_counter. Beyond that... you'll need to figure out what the function does before changing it if you expect it to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ***Assistant Mode*** Technically this could be considered part of 3), but it's different enough that I feel it warrants separate explanation. By default, the notebook is configured to produce RP-style data; \"Assistant mode\" is something you can toggle in the settings cell immediately below this one, which skips character and scenario generation and answers every question in a chat between a user and a helpful AI assistant (with no personality). This can be handled by smaller models, so if your budget or time are very limited, or you are using this for a more professional use case, feel free to turn this on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ***Change the model.*** This is as simple as switching the LOGICAL_MODEL value out for another one, but your mileage may vary significantly. My personal recommendation is to use [Hermes Mixtral DPO](https://api.together.xyz/playground/chat/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO) for both models. You need at least 12k context on your model, and APIs typically don't allow RoPE scaling, so you're probably limited to MistralAI models here (or, heavens forbid, OpenAI. But GPT-4.5 + Augmentoolkit will BANKRUPT you fast, so be wary).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Change the examples.*** If you change the examples you can completely overhaul what this notebook does, but this requires a lot of prompting skill and possibly huge amounts of time to get it working again (source: most of my last three months were spent prompting, and most of this prompting was spent on the examples). Unless you want to convert this notebook from question-and-answer generation to some completely other task, I'd recommend changing only the conversation generation prompts -- they're a bit less finnicky, and if you just want to change the kind of characters generated (maybe you want a different writing style) that's where you'd find the differences.\n",

      "Step 1. Identify Paragraph Content: This paragraph is from the introductory section of \"Through England on a Side Saddle\" by Celia Fiennes, including copyright and publication information.\n",
      "Step 2. Evaluate Educational Relevance: The paragraph contains legal, copyright, and publication information specific to the book's distribution and not its content.\n",
      "Step 3. Assess Specific Contexts and Formats:\n",
      "  - Purely Descriptive Lists: The paragraph is a descriptive list of publication details without educational content.\n",
      "  - Dialogues or Quotes Without Context: Not applicable.\n",
      "  - Ambiguous or Unclear Texts: The text is clear but lacks educational substance.\n",
      "Step 4. Assess the Possibility of Formulating Questions: The paragraph's content does not lend itself to educational questions due to its focus on publication rather than substantive content.\n",
      "Step 5. Determine Suitability for Educational Purposes: The paragraph lacks thematic, historical, scientific, or literary information and is thus unsuitable for creating educational questions.\n",
      "Step 6. Check for Contextual Completeness: The paragraph, while complete in its context, does not offer educational insights or concepts.\n",
      "Step 7. Final Judgment: Unsuitable for educational questions.</s>\n",

For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners. These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers.

MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.\n",

Estimates of the proportion of the population engaged in sabotage can be disseminated. Instances of successful sabotage already are being broadcast by white radio and freedom stations, and this should be continued and expanded where compatible with security. (c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance.

      "Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error.”   2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS  Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe.\n",

      "(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many simple saboteurs are arrested.\n",

      "A listing of specific acts follows, classified according to types of target. This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1) _Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage. They are extremely susceptible to damage, especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors, charwomen, and casual visitors; and, when damaged, they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy. (a) _Fires_ can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material. Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone. (1) Whenever possible, arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away. Use a candle and paper, combination, setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper, tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.\n",

(3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.\n",

(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage, resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens. Loiterers arouse suspicion. Of course, there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave. If you commit sabotage on your job, you should naturally stay at your work. 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING  The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled. Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation. Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors, moreover, might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity. Sabotage suggestions, of course, should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced. Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified, for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press, freedom stations, and cooperating propaganda.

      "An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value. Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR  To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem. Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude toward materials and tools.\n",

      "(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time, and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.\n",

Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed. (1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds. Among such facilities are roads, railroads, auto mobiles, trucks, motor-cycles, bicycles, trains, and trams. (2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage. These include telephone, telegraph and power systems, radio, newspapers, placards, and public notices. (3) Critical materials, valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication, also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur.

      "In the world of science, there are countless mysteries and phenomena that elude easy explanation. For instance, certain forces and energies interact in ways that are not fully understood, shaping the universe in subtle and profound manners. These interactions often occur at levels beyond human perception, leaving much to speculation and theory. Various scientific disciplines attempt to explain these interactions, each offering unique perspectives but often lacking definitive answers. The vastness of these mysteries spans from the minuscule quantum realm to the expansive cosmos, hinting at complexities that challenge our current understanding.\n",

      "Purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature. He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage. (1) _Personal Motives_ (a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. (b) Since the effect of his own acts is limited, the saboteur may become discouraged unless he feels that he is a member of a large, though unseen, group of saboteurs operating against the enemy or the government of his own country and elsewhere. This can be conveyed indirectly: suggestions which he reads and hears can include observations that a particular technique has been successful in this or that district. Even if the technique is not applicable to his surroundings, another’s success will encourage him to attempt similar acts.\n",
