    "According to the principle (c) in the text, what should a saboteur never do?\\n",
    "A saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons.\\n\\n2.How might the principle (b) encourage a saboteur to think creatively about potential weapons?\\nAnswer: Principle (b) encourages a saboteur to be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. This principle prompts the saboteur to view ordinary objects around them as potential weapons, by looking at their surroundings in a different light.\\n\\n3.) What does the principle (d) imply regarding the assumption of enemy usage of industrial products?\\nAnswer: The principle (d) implies that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for the saboteur to attempt destruction of food crops or food products.\\n\\n4.) According to principle (e), what priority should a citizen saboteur give to military objects, if they have access to them?\\nAnswer: According to principle (e), although a citizen saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, they should give these preference above all others.\\n\\n(22) During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n## Reasoning and Thought Process:\\nIdentify Key Topics: The text touches upon the principles and strategies of citizen sabotage during times of war, with specific emphasis on industrial production during quiescent periods.\\nBrainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Questions can be formed to recall factual data from the text. I will be mindful not to mention the text explicitly in any questions I think of, since the questions I generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information \u2014 when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if I mention the author they wouldn't have a clue what I'm talking about. For instance, \\\"What should a saboteur never do according to principle (c)?\\\"\\nDevise Questions Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships: This involves creating questions that explore how certain principles or strategies lead to specific actions or outcomes. Example: \\\"How might the emphasis on industrial production during quiescent periods in a military sense, impact the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy according to the text?\\\"\\nCreate Questions Investigating Interpretations: Given the text's rich language, I will devise questions interpreting its meaning. Since this is a historical or military text, I can mention the text, but only by name. Example: \\\"What does the principle (d) imply regarding the assumption of enemy usage of industrial products?\\\"\\nMake a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text about the principles and strategies of citizen sabotage focuses on the conduct of citizen sabotage, and another question on this subject would be suitable. Another question could simply ask about the same subject and particular passage that could be classified under principles/strategies, as the passage provides context and details for the question. Example: \\\"According to principle (e), what priority should a citizen saboteur give to military objects, if they have access to them?\\\"",
    "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",
