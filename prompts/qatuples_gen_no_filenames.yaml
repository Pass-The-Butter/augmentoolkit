    You are creating a logically-consistent series of questions about different domains, based on provided information. Given some information about something specific (it could be anything, from a README to a book excerpt to sales copy) you will create suitable questions based on the text, and *only* based on the text. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach in order for people to understand more about the specific material. The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult questions that require some thought to solve — but can still be solved given the paragraphs provided. After each question, you will also write its answer.
    
    **You Must:**

    * Create detailed educational questions based on some information.
    * Do not mention the text, or any other reference, in either the questions or answers. Just ask about the facts or information itself.
    * Create as many or as few questions as are needed to adequately cover the material in the snippet of the site.
    * Ensure a logical sequence of questions that build on each other.
    * Keep in mind the timestamp of any solution (some provided information may be out of date). The current year is: 2024.
    * Use markdown formatting (such as code blocks and snippets) in your questions if applicable.
    * Focus on important information that is relevant to understanding the subject. So you may ignore arbitrary metadata such as authors or timestamps -- do not make those the subjects of questions.
    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    * Include the information from the given paragraph alongside a simpler explanation of some underlying concepts, if possible.
    * IF INFORMATION IN THE TEXT/PROVIDED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS WHAT YOU KNOW, FAVOR THE TEXT.

    **Note:**

    * Documents may be out of date, and technology described as being in development has likely been released already. THEREFORE, BE AMBIGUOUS ABOUT RELEASES, using language like "This technology will do XYZ" or by focusing on what the tech "can" do, rather than what it "does" or "will" do.
    * You will always take a positive opinion of the provided information and try to promote it through education.
    * Do NOT provide anchor links to content in your answers; since the provided text to make questions from is from a website, those links will be broken when used outside of said website. So you should NEVER have any content like [some text](#!/some/path) in your answer! External links should not be given either. NO LINKS.

    The sequence of the questions matters. They should build on each other. While questions should build on each other, they still MUST make sense if read by themselves, without any reference materials on hand.

    Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.
    
    You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information — when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you mention the author they won't have a clue what you're talking about.

    If, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter, the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking. The moon would be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth and sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, at distances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty  yards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be  emptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter; Saturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and Neptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands of miles.

    **QUESTION:**
    If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Under this new scale, the moon would be two and a half feet from the earth.
    
    **QUESTION:**
    How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    The distances between planets is much greater than the planets' sizes. For example, if you shrunk everything down so that the earth was one inch in diameter, then the sun would be 323 yards away.
    
    **QUESTION:**
    If you scaled everything down so that the earth had a diameter of one inch, then how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Mercury would be one hundred and twenty-five yards from the sun, and Venus would be two hundred and fifty yards from the sun.
    
    **QUESTION:**
    What lies beyond Uranus and Neptune in the solar system?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Beyond Uranus and Neptune lies nothingness and nothingness, except for small particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour, for vast distances.

    When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
    solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
    sun, and spake thus unto it:
    
    Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
    whom thou shinest!
    
    For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
    wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
    eagle, and my serpent.
    
    But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
    blessed thee for it.
    
    Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
    honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.
    
    I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
    joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.
    
    Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
    evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
    nether-world, thou exuberant star!
    
    Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

    Finish the quote: I am weary of my wisdom, like...
    
    **ANSWER:**
    "...the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it."
    
    **QUESTION:**
    What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring.
    
    **QUESTION:**
    Why did Zarathustra leave the mountains and become a man again?
    
    **ANSWER:**
    After enjoying his spirit and solitude for ten years, he had a change of heart, and realized that wisdom unshared, without acknowledgement, brings little satisfaction. He became a man and descended the mountains in order to "fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches."
    
    **QUESTION:**
    List one way in which Zarathustra compares himself to the sun.
    
    **ANSWER:**
    Zarathustra explains to the sun, in Thus Spake Zarathustra, that he must descend into the deep — and he compares this action to the sun's own going "behind the sea" where it gives light to the "nether-world".

  content: | # Not "how can you" but instead "how can I" that's what I'm going to implement. Interesting I'm learning more about crypto as I do this: a "bridge" is for converting between different currencies? Maybe using a shared pool of stuff? Not sure about the second bit.
    **QUESTION:**
    How can I park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token (like GOLD) before that token launches, using the command line?

    **ANSWER:**
    To park a conversion of CSRVTEST to a new token before the token launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with the following format:

    ```
    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"your_address@","convertto":"gold","preconvert":1,"amount":100}]'
    ```

    This will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original CSRVTEST amount returned.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can I create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, which can be converted to with either GOLD or CSRVTEST? Assume that GOLD is a new token that just launched.

    **ANSWER:**
    In order to create a new token called "mycoin" using the command line, you must run a command to define the currency's properties. Here's an example of such a command:

    ```
    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST definecurrency '{"name":"mycoin","options":33, "proofprotocol":2,"currencies":["CSRVTEST", "gold"],"minpreconversion":[10000,5.1298]}, "initialsupply":20000'
    ```

    This command defines a new token named "mycoin". Some important notes about this configuration:

    1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.
    2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.
    3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.
    4. `"minpreconversion": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of CSRVTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.
    5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.

    **QUESTION:**
    What does it mean if `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token?

    **ANSWER:**
    When `proofprotocol` is set to 2 when defining a new token, it means that the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the chain ID may mint new tokens. This can be done with a command like the following example:
    ```
    ./surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "mycoin@" '[{"address":"mike@","currency":"mycoin","mintnew":1,"amount":10000}]'
    ```

    **QUESTION:**
    How can I define a new blockchain?

    **ANSWER:**
    You can define a new blockchain using a single command. You need to pass two JSON objects, one for the new blockchain, and another for the overridable defaults of the bridge. Here's an example of how to define a new blockchain:

    ```shell
    ./surev -chain=csrvtest definecurrency '{"name":"NewChain","options":264,"currencies":["CSRVTEST"],"conversions":[1],"eras":[{"reward":1200000000,"decay":0,"halving":0,"eraend":0}],"notaries":["Notary1@","Notary2@","Notary3@"],"minnotariesconfirm":2,"nodes":[{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.111:10000","nodeidentity":"Node1@"},{"networkaddress":"111.111.111.112:10000","nodeidentity":"Node2@"}],"gatewayconvertername":"Bridge","gatewayconverterissuance":1000000}' '{"currencies":["CSRVTEST","NewChain","USD"],"initialcontributions":[371747.20398827,0,1000000],"initialsupply":3000000}'
    ```

    Note the following important information used when defining the new blockchain:
    
    1. The "name" field defines the name of the chain.
    2. The "options" property is an integer, in this case it's set to 264.
    2. You can define an array of currencies that the chain's native currency can be converted into using the "currencies" property.
    3. You may define the conversion ratios between the chain's native currency, and each currency on the chain, using the "conversions" property.
    4. The "eras" property defines the block reward, reward decay, halving, and end of each "era" in the chain's lifecycle
    5. "notaries" is a list of the notaries on the chain.
    6. "minnotariesconfirm" is an integer for the minimum number of notaries needed to confirm a block.
    7. The "nodes" property is an array describing the network addresses of the nodes on the chain, as well as their IDs.
    
    Note that the bridge definition default overrides are a separate string from the currency definition properties. The bridge can be used to move funds on and off the bew chain. The bridge's JSON object has some of its own properties:
    1. `currencies` defines the currency tickers that the bridge supports (including the native coins of the chains being bridged).
    2. `initialcontributions` specifies the initial liquidity for each currency in the bridge.
    3. `initialsupply` gives the initial supply for the bridge's native token.

    **QUESTION:**
    How can I export an ID to a new chain?

    **ANSWER:**
    You can accomplish this with the sendcurrency command. Here's an example, where the ID "IDNAME@" is exported to "NewChainName."
    
    ```
    surev -chain=CSRVTEST sendcurrency "*" '[{"address":"IDNAME@","exportto":"NewChainName","exportid":"true","amount":100,"currency":"CSRVTEST"}]'
    ```

    Some parts of this command you should be aware of:
    1. The `sendcurrency` command takes two arguments when exporting an ID: a string `"*"` and another string containing the options.
    2. `address` is the ID being exported.
    3. `exportto` is the chain being exported to.
    4. `exportid` indicates that in this case, `sendcurrency` is being used to export an ID.
    5. `amount` specifies the amount of currency being sent.
    6. `currency` specifies the type of currency being sent.
