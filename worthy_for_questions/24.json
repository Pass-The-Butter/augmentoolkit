{"paragraph": "(6) Send up quantities of rock and other useless material with the coal. (5) _Production: Agriculture_ (a) Machinery (1) See par. 5 b. (2) (c), (d), (e). (b) Crops and livestock probably will be destroyed only in areas where there are large food surpluses or where the enemy (regime) is known to be requisitioning food. (1.) Feed crops to livestock. Let crops harvest too early or too late. Spoil stores of grain, fruit and vegetables by soaking them in water so that they will rot. Spoil fruit and vegetables by leaving them in the sun. (6) _Transportation: Railways_ (a) Passengers (1.) Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy personnel. Make mistakes in issuing train tickets, leaving portions of the journey uncovered by the ticket book; issue two tickets for the same seat in the train, so that an interesting argument will result; near train time, instead of issuing printed tickets write them out slowly by hand, prolonging the process until the train is nearly ready to leave or has left the station. On station bulletin boards announcing train arrivals and departures, see that false and misleading information is given about trains bound for enemy destinations. (2) In trains bound for enemy destinations, attendants should make life as uncomfortable as possible for passengers.", "metadata": "./raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"}
