(3) Put a coin beneath a bulb in a public building during the daytime, so that fuses will blow out when lights are turned on at night. The fuses themselves may be rendered ineffective by putting a coin behind them or loading them with heavy wire. Then a short-circuit may either start a fire, damage transformers, or blow out a central fuse which will interrupt distribution of electricity to a large area. (4) Jam paper, bits of wood, hairpins, and anything else that will fit, into the locks of all unguarded entrances to public buildings. (2) _Industrial Production: Manufacturing_ (a) Tools (1) Let cutting tools grow dull. They will be inefficient, will slow down production, and may damage the materials and parts you use them on. (2) Leave saws slightly twisted when you are not using them. After a while, they will break when used. (3) Using a very rapid stroke will wear out a file before its time. So will dragging a file in slow strokes under heavy pressure. Exert pressure on the backward stroke as well as the forward stroke. (4) Clean files by knocking them against the vise or the workpiece; they are easily broken this way. (5) Bits and drills will snap under heavy pressure.", "metadata": "./raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"}
