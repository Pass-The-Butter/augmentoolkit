{"paragraph": "If workmen can damage insulation on a high tension line near an enemy airfield, they will make ground-to-plane radio communications difficult and perhaps impossible during long periods of the day. (10) _Electric Power_ (a) Turbines, Electric Motors, Transformers (1) See 5 b. (2) (e), (f),and (g). (b) Transmission Lines (1.) Linesmen can loosen and dirty insulators to cause power leakage. It will be quite easy, too, for them to tie a piece of very heavy string several times back and forth between two parallel transmission lines, winding it several turns around the wire each time. Beforehand, the string should be heavily saturated with salt and then dried. When it rains, the string becomes a conductor, and a short-circuit will result. (11) _General Interference with Organizations and Production_ (a) Organizations and Conferences (1) Insist on doing everything through \u201cchannels.\u201d Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions. (2) Make \u201cspeeches.\u201d Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your \u201cpoints\u201d by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate \u201cpatriotic\u201d comments. (3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for \u201cfurther study and consideration.\u201d Attempt to make the committees as large as possible\u2014never less than five. (4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.", "metadata": "./raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"}
