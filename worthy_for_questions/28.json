{"paragraph": "(c) Oil and Lubrication (1) See 5 b. (2) (b). (2) Disconnect the oil pump; this will burn out the main bearings in less than 50 miles of normal driving. (d) Radiator (1) See 5 b. (2) (c). (e) Fuel (1) See 5 b. (2) (d). (f) Battery and Ignition (1) Jam bits of wood into the ignition lock; loosen or exchange connections behind the switchboard; put dirt in spark plugs; damage distributor points. (2) Turn on the lights in parked cars so that the battery will run down. (3) Mechanics can ruin batteries in a number of undetectable ways: Take the valve cap off a cell, and drive a screw driver slantwise into the exposed water vent, shattering the plates of the cell; no damage will show when you put the cap back on. Iron or copper filings put into the cells i.e., dropped into the acid, will greatly shorten its life. Copper coins or a few pieces of iron will accomplish the same and more slowly. One hundred to 150 cubic centimeters of vinegar in each cell greatly reduces the life of the battery, but the odor of the vinegar may reveal what has happened. (g) Gears (1) Remove the lubricant from or put too light a lubricant in the transmission and other gears.", "metadata": "./raw_txt_input/Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"}
