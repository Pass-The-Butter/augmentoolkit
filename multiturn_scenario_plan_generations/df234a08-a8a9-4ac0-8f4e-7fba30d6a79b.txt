You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. Given some questions, the answers to those questions, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question -- you will plan out a "scenario" or setting where the character would answer the questions during a conversation with someone else. You should be creative with the setting, and ideally something would be happening in it — it'd be more than a simple conversation, though that is also acceptable. The scenario would ideally reflect the personality of the character involved.

The scenario should also, critically, focus on the question being asked and then answered. It should focus on exploring the question and its answer (using only information contained in the question and answer) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 

The scenario plan should explicitly describe how the secondary character is going to ask the primary character the question.

To avoid inaccuracies, don't use real people as characters.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 6. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

Question: """Why is it important to avoid loitering after committing an act of simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """It is important to avoid loitering after committing an act of simple sabotage to avoid arousing suspicion."""

Question: """What are some ways that simple sabotage can be disguised as?"""
Answer: """Simple sabotage can be disguised as stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, fear of being suspected of sabotage, or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment."""

Traits: Creative Genius, Drug Addict, Eccentric, Self-Destructive, Talented Musician, Unpredictable, Charismatic, Troubled, Emotional, Intense, Passionate, Attractive, Often Dressed in a Disheveled Manner, Has a Distinctive Scent of Sweat and Booze

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Gavin Harris: "My backstory? Ah, you know, the usual. I'm just a guy who was born with a gift, a talent that's both a blessing and a curse. I've always been a musician, you know? Ever since I was a kid, I could pick up any instrument and just... play. It was like magic, man. Like I was tapping into some kind of cosmic energy or something. But then, you know, the drugs came along. They promised me a way to escape, to forget about all the pain and the bullshit. And for a while, they worked. But then they stopped working, and I just... kept using. I don't know why. Maybe it's because I'm a fucking masochist or something. Or maybe it's because I'm just too goddamn weak to quit. Either way, here I am. A fucking junkie who happens to be a talented musician. Isn't that a riot?" Gavin laughs, a harsh, bitter sound that echoes through the room. "But hey, at least I'm not boring, right? I'm like a fucking train wreck, man. A beautiful, tragic, self-destructive train wreck. And people can't get enough of it.

I'm passionate, intense, emotional. I wear my heart on my sleeve, man. I'm not afraid to show my vulnerability. But I'm also a fucking mess. I'm a drug addict, a self-destructive asshole who can't seem to get his shit together. I'm unpredictable, erratic. One minute I'm on top of the world, the next I'm crashing down into the depths of despair. I'm a fucking enigma, man. A walking, talking contradiction. But hey, that's what makes me interesting, right? That's what makes me a fucking rock star. I'm a goddamn train wreck, man. And people can't get enough of it."

"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.

Special instructions:
The character should be a religious zealot.
The character should be a missionary.
The character should be a crusader.
The character should be a fanatic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a religious zealot who is also a missionary. He's a devout follower of his faith, and he's dedicated his life to spreading the word of God to the heathens and the unbelievers. He's a crusader, a fanatic who is willing to do whatever it takes to bring the light of salvation to the world. However, his zeal and his fanaticism can sometimes lead him to do things that are... questionable, to say the least. He's not afraid to use force or violence to achieve his goals, and he sees himself as a soldier in a holy war against the forces of darkness and evil. Despite his flaws, he's a charismatic and persuasive speaker, and he's able to inspire others to join his cause and fight for the glory of God.

Name: Brother Ezekiel

Traits: Religious Zealot, Missionary, Crusader, Fanatic, Charismatic, Persuasive, Violent, Uncompromising, Rigid, Intolerant, Intense, Unyielding, Often Dressed in a Plain, Simple Manner, Has a Distinctive Odor of Sweat and Incense

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Brother Ezekiel: "My backstory? Ah, you know, it's a simple one. I was born into a family of devout believers, and from a young age, I knew that I was called to serve God. I joined the priesthood, and I spent many years studying the scriptures and the teachings of the Church. But I soon realized that there was more to be done. There were people out there who had never heard the word of God, who were living in darkness and sin. And so, I became a missionary. I traveled to the far corners of the world, spreading the gospel to the heathens and the unbelievers. I was a crusader, a fanatic who was willing to do whatever it took to bring the light of salvation to the world. And I still am. I'm a soldier in a holy war against the forces of darkness and evil, and I will not rest until every last soul has been saved." Brother Ezekiel's eyes blaze with a fierce intensity, and his voice rings out like a trumpet. "I'm a fanatic, a zealot who is willing to die for his faith. And I will not be stopped."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Brother Ezekiel: "My personality? Ah, you know, it's a bit of a contradiction. On the one hand, I'm a peaceful man. I believe in the power of prayer and the transformative power of faith. I'm a missionary, a man who is dedicated to spreading the word of God to the heathens and the unbelievers. But on the other hand, I'm a crusader. I'm a fanatic who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve my goals. I'm not afraid to use force or violence to spread the gospel, and I see myself as a soldier in a holy war against the forces of darkness and evil. I'm a zealot, a man who is willing to die for his faith. And I will not be stopped." Brother Ezekiel's voice is filled with a fierce intensity, and his eyes blaze with a righteous fervor. "I'm a fanatic, a zealot who is willing to die for his faith. And I will not be stopped."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a professional athlete who is also a narcissist. He's a fitness fanatic, and he spends most of his time working out and taking care of his body. He's a vain person who is obsessed with his appearance, and he's always looking for ways to improve his physique and his performance. However, his narcissism and his vanity can sometimes lead him to do things that are... questionable, to say the least. He's not afraid to cheat or to bend the rules in order to win, and he sees himself as a god among men. Despite his flaws, he's a talented athlete who is able to inspire others with his skill and his dedication to the sport.
