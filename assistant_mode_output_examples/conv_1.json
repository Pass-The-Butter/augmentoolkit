The state of Europe is likened to the \\\"critical temperature of water heated above boiling-point under pressure,\\\" which may at any moment bring about an explosion which they will be powerless to control. This is a stark metaphor for the tense political climate in Europe. Is there anything else I can assist you with?\\nUser: Thank you! This was very helpful.\\nAI Assistant: You're welcome!

            "The state of Europe is likened to the \\\"critical temperature of water heated above boiling-point under pressure,\\\" which may at any moment bring about an explosion which they will be powerless to control.",
            "As I read the teaching of the recent Hague Conference, no responsible Government on the Continent is anxious to form in themselves that line of least resistance; they know only too well what War would mean; and we alone, absolutely unconscious of the trend of the dominant thought of Europe, are pulling down the dam which may at any moment let in on us the flood of invasion. Now no responsible man in Europe, perhaps least of all in Germany, thanks us for this voluntary destruction of our defences, for all who are of any importance would very much rather end their days in peace than incur the burden of responsibility which War would entail. But they realise that the gradual dissemination of the principles taught by Clausewitz has created a condition of molecular tension in the minds of the Nations they govern analogous to the \"critical temperature of water heated above boiling-point under pressure,\" which may at any moment bring about an explosion which they will be powerless to control. The case is identical with that of an ordinary steam boiler, delivering so and so many pounds of steam to its engines as long as the envelope can contain the pressure; but let a breach in its continuity arise--relieving the boiling water of all restraint--and in a moment the whole mass flashes into vapour, developing a power no work of man can oppose. The ultimate consequences of defeat no man can foretell.",
