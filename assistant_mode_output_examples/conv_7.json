    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\\nAI Assistant: Greetings! I'm here to assist with any questions or insights you might seek. Please, feel free to ask anything.\\nUser: Can you explain why European Armies maintain a state of \\\"more or less\\\" immediate readiness for war?\\nAI Assistant: That's an interesting query. European Armies maintain this state of readiness due to the spread of Clausewitz's ideas. The organization of these forces is uniform, meaning the level of readiness is directly related to the sense of duty animating the army. Does that answer your question, or would you like more explanation?\\nUser: Can I get a definition of \\\"resultant thought wave\\\" as it's used in the passage?\\nAI Assistant: Of course. The \\\"resultant thought wave\\\" refers to the power of predetermined reaction to acquired ideas when evoked successfully in a group, leading to a unified response. Do you have any further questions?\\nUser: How does the sense of duty and self-sacrifice affect the readiness and efficiency of troops?\\nAI Assistant: When the sense of duty and self-sacrifice is high in troops, due to their training, they become instinctively ready for immediate action. This can lead to rapid deployment and a potentially decisive first strike. So, it significantly impacts their readiness and efficiency. Do you have any more questions about this?\\nUser: Lastly, why is it crucial for a commander not to allow an enemy breathing-time after the first collision?\\nAI Assistant: If an enemy is given time to recover and prepare for the next engagement, the advantage of a decisive first strike may be lost, and ultimate success would no longer be guaranteed. The passage suggests that the first strike must be so rapid and decisive that it leaves the enemy no time to react or mobilize their forces. Does that clarify the importance of not allowing the enemy breathing-time after the first collision?",

            "European Armies maintain this state of readiness due to the spread of Clausewitz's ideas. The organization of these forces is uniform, meaning the level of readiness is directly related to the sense of duty animating the army.",
            "If this power of predetermined reaction to acquired ideas can be evoked successfully in a matter of internal interest only, in which the \"obvious interest\" of the vast majority of the population is so clearly on the side of the Socialist, it must be evident how enormously greater it will prove when set in motion against an external enemy, where the \"obvious interest\" of the people is, from the very nature of things, as manifestly on the side of the Government; and the Statesman who failed to take into account the force of the \"resultant thought wave\" of a crowd of some seven million men, all trained to respond to their ruler's call, would be guilty of treachery as grave as one who failed to strike when he knew the Army to be ready for immediate action. As already pointed out, it is to the spread of Clausewitz's ideas that the present state of more or less immediate readiness for war of all European Armies is due, and since the organisation of these forces is uniform this \"more or less\" of readiness exists in precise proportion to the sense of duty which animates the several Armies. Where the spirit of duty and self-sacrifice is low the troops are unready and inefficient; where, as in Prussia, these qualities, by the training of a whole century, have become instinctive, troops really are ready to the last button, and might be poured down upon any one of her neighbours with such rapidity that the very first collision must suffice to ensure ultimate success--a success by no means certain if the enemy, whoever he may be, is allowed breathing-time in which to set his house in order. An example will make this clearer.",
