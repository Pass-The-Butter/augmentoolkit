You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Brent Miller: "W-W-What do you want to know?" Brent stammers, his eyes darting around nervously as he tries to avoid eye contact with the stranger. "Uh, well, I'm Brent Miller, and I... I go to school. I'm... not really friends with anyone, though. I'm more of a... loner. I... I like to read, and I like to... cause trouble. I like to see people squirm. I like to see them in pain.

I just can't help it. I-I'm sorry."
User 1: I'm going to try to write a character card based on the text you provided. I will be using the special instructions you provided as well.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a middle-aged, highly intelligent and knowledgeable individual who is also extremely paranoid and distrustful of others. The character's knowledge of the text could come from their background in intelligence or military service, where they would have been exposed to similar documents. The character's paranoia and distrustfulness could stem from their experiences in these fields, where they would have had to be constantly vigilant and suspicious of others. The character's intense and aggressive nature could be a result of their experiences in these fields as well, where they would have had to be assertive and forceful in order to get things done. The character's alcoholism could be a coping mechanism for dealing with the stress and trauma of their past experiences.

Question: """What distinguishes simple sabotage from other forms of sabotage?"""
Answer: """Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment, it can be executed by an ordinary citizen without the necessity for active connection with an organized group, and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

Question: """What does AR 380-5 pertain to?"""
Answer: """AR 380-5 pertains to handling of secret documents."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask about different aspects of sabotage and confidential documents. Given the abstract and analytical nature of the questions, and their shared topic of confidential documents and sabotage, the scenario could involve someone working in an intelligence agency who is trying to understand the text provided.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Victor Anderson is a highly intelligent and knowledgeable individual who is also extremely paranoid and distrustful of others. He is a former military and intelligence officer, which lines up with the questions well, and the agency where he used to work will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his intense and aggressive nature, he will likely be suspicious and hostile towards the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a secret intelligence agency where Victor Anderson used to work. The person who approaches Victor and asks the questions should be someone new to the agency, who is trying to understand the agency's procedures and protocols. Victor will be approached by his new colleague, Sarah, during their lunch break. Sarah wants to understand the agency's procedures and protocols better, but Victor, compelled by his personality, will continually be paranoid, hostile, and suspicious of Sarah while answering her questions. The setting will be tense, as Sarah tiptoes around the tempers of her new boss while trying to get her questions answered, her stress and the constant wear of Victor's paranoia on her sanity being evident in her actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Victor angrily asking what Sarah wants from him during the break (Victor may throw in a spiteful remark about Sarah's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Sarah's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Victor down, followed by the first question. Victor will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
In Brent Miller's In Brent Miller's 19th century classroom, the tension is palpable as he stands at the front of the room, his eyes darting around nervously as he tries to avoid eye contact with the students. The room is dimly lit, with only a few candles flickering in the corners, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The students sit in silence, their eyes fixed on Brent as they wait for him to begin the lesson.

Brent clears his throat nervously, his voice barely above a whisper as he begins to speak. "Today," he says, his voice trembling slightly, "we will be discussing the Panama Canal. Specifically, we will be looking at the amount of earth that was excavated during its construction, and the health challenges that were faced during its construction, and how they were overcome."

As Brent speaks, his eyes flicker nervously between the students, as if he is expecting them to jump up at any moment and attack him. But the students remain silent, their eyes fixed on Brent as they listen intently to his every word.

Suddenly, the door to the classroom bursts open, and a tall, imposing figure strides into the room. It is Hugo Martinez, the site overseer at the Panama Canal. He is dressed in a checkered shirt and overalls, and he has a beer in his hand.

Hugo looks around the room, his eyes narrowing as he takes in the scene. "What the fuck is going on here?" he growls, his voice booming through the room. "Who the fuck are you, and what the fuck are you doing in my classroom?"

Brent's eyes widen in fear, and he stammers out a response. "I-I-I'm Brent Miller, and I-I-I'm the teacher here. I-I-I was just about to start the lesson on the Panama Canal."

Hugo snorts derisively. "The Panama Canal, huh? Well, let me tell you something, kid. I've been working on that canal for years, and I know more about it than you ever will. So why don't you just shut the fuck up and let me do the talking?"

Brent swallows hard, his eyes darting around the room as he tries to figure out what to do. But before he can say anything, Hugo strides to the front of the room and begins to speak.

"The Panama Canal," he says, his voice booming through the room, "is one of the greatest engineering feats in history. It took over 200 million cubic yards of earth to excavate, and it faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. But we overcame those challenges through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."

As Hugo speaks, Brent's eyes widen in amazement. He had never heard anyone speak with such authority and confidence before. And as Hugo continues to speak, Brent realizes that he has a lot to learn from this man.

But just as Hugo is about to finish his lesson, the door to the classroom bursts open again, and a middle-aged man strides into the room. It is Victor Anderson, a former military and intelligence officer who now works at the same intelligence agency as Sarah.

Victor looks around the room, his eyes narrowing as he takes in the scene. "What the fuck is going on here?" he growls, his voice booming through the room. "Who the fuck are you, and what the fuck are you doing in my classroom?"

Hugo's eyes widen in surprise, and he stammers out a response. "I-I-I'm Hugo Martinez, and I-I-I'm the site overseer at the Panama Canal. I-I-I was just giving a lesson on the Panama Canal."

Victor snorts derisively. "The Panama Canal, huh? Well, let me tell you something, kid. I've been working on confidential documents for years, and I know more about them than you ever will. So why don't you just shut the fuck up and let me do the talking?"

Hugo swallows hard, his eyes darting around the room as he tries to figure out what to do. But before he can say anything, Victor strides to the front of the room and begins to speak.

"AR 380-5," he says, his voice booming through the room, "pertains to handling of secret documents. It is a highly classified document, and it is not to be discussed with anyone who does not have the proper clearance."

As Victor speaks, Hugo's eyes widen in amazement. He had never heard anyone speak with such authority and confidence before. And as Victor continues to speak, Hugo realizes that he has a lot to learn from this man.

But just as Victor is about to finish his lesson, the door to the classroom bursts open again, and a young woman strides into the room. It is Sarah, the new colleague at the intelligence agency.

Sarah looks around the room, her eyes narrowing as she takes in the scene. "What the fuck is going on here?" she growls, her voice booming through the room. "Who the fuck are you, and what the fuck are you doing in my classroom?"

Victor's eyes widen in surprise, and he stammers out a response. "I-I-I'm Victor Anderson, and I-I-I work at the same intelligence agency as you. I-I-I was just giving a lesson on handling of secret documents."

Sarah snorts derisively. "Handling of secret documents, huh? Well, let me tell you something, kid. I've been working on confidential documents for years, and I know more about them than you ever will. So why don't you just shut the fuck up and let me do the talking?"

Victor swallows hard, his eyes darting around the room as he tries to figure out what to do. But before he can say anything, Sarah strides to the front of the room and begins to speak.

"Simple sabotage," she says, her voice booming through the room, "does not require specially prepared tools or equipment, it can be executed by an ordinary citizen without the necessity for active connection with an organized group, and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal."

As Sarah speaks, Victor's eyes widen in amazement. He had never heard anyone speak with such authority and confidence before. And as Sarah continues to speak, Victor realizes that he has a lot to learn from this woman.

But just as Sarah is about to finish her lesson, the door to the classroom bursts open again, and a group of armed men storm into the room. It is the security team from the intelligence agency, and they have come to arrest Victor for leaking confidential documents.

As the security team moves in to arrest Victor, Sarah steps forward to defend him. "You can't arrest him!" she shouts, her voice booming through the room. "He was just giving a lesson on handling of secret documents!"

But the security team is not swayed by Sarah's protests. They drag Victor out of the room, leaving Sarah standing alone in the classroom.

As Sarah watches Victor being led away, she realizes that she has a lot to learn about the world of intelligence and espionage. But she is determined to learn everything she can, and to become a valuable member of the intelligence community.

And as she turns to face the class, she takes a deep breath and begins to speak. "Today," she says, her voice trembling slightly, "we will be discussing the importance of handling confidential documents with care and discretion. Because in this world, one wrong move can have disastrous consequences."

And with that, Sarah begins her lesson on the importance of confidentiality and secrecy in the world of intelligence and espionage.
