    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"Our force of\
    \ artillery is large in proportion to the other arms of  service, while the number\
    \ of our engineer troops is ridiculously and  shamefully small; it is, therefore,\
    \ more than probable that in any  future siege it will be easy for the artillery\
    \ to construct their own  batteries, while the engineers will be sufficiently\
    \ burdened by the  construction of the other works of attack; we have now, at\
    \ last, the  germ of an artillery school of practice; I would then suggest, for\
    \ the  consideration of the Secretary, the propriety of causing the artillery\
    \  to construct their own batteries. The position and armament of siege  batteries\
    \ should be determined by consultation between the engineers and  the artillery,\
    \ the former having the preponderating voice, in order to  secure the necessary\
    \ harmony and connection between all parts of the  works of attack. This change,\"\
    \ he says, \"will require to be introduced  into the artillery manual and course\
    \ of instruction everything in  relation to the preparation of the fascines, gabions,\
    \ platforms, and  magazines, the dimensions of batteries, manner of arranging,\
    \ working  parties, etc.\"\"\"\""

    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\

    \ words or phrases: \"ridiculously\", \"shamefully\", \"easy\", \"probable\",\
    \ \"sufficiently\", \"burdened\", \"necessary\", \"harmony\", \"connection\",\
    \ \"secure\", \"introduced\", \"require\", \"everything\", \"relation\", \"preparation\"\
    , \"fascines\", \"gabions\", \"platforms\", \"magazines\", \"dimensions\", \"\
    manner\", \"arranging\", \"working\", \"parties\"\n* Assign sentiment scores:\n\
    \t+ \"ridiculously\" and \"shamefully\" are negative sentiment-bearing words,\
    \ so assign -1 to each.\n\t+ \"easy\" and \"probable\" are positive sentiment-bearing\
    \ words, so assign +1 to each.\n\t+ \"sufficiently\" and \"burdened\" are neutral\
    \ sentiment-bearing words, so assign 0 to each.\n\t+ \"necessary\" and \"harmony\"\
    \ are positive sentiment-bearing words, so assign +1 to each.\n\t+ \"secure\"\
    \ is a positive sentiment-bearing word, so assign +1 to it.\n\t+ \"introduced\"\
    \ and \"require\" are neutral sentiment-bearing words, so assign 0 to each.\n\t\
    + \"everything\" and \"relation\" are neutral sentiment-bearing words, so assign\
    \ 0 to each.\n\t+ \"preparation\", \"fascines\", \"gabions\", \"platforms\", \"\
    magazines\", \"dimensions\", \"manner\", \"arranging\", \"working\", \"parties\"\
    \ are neutral sentiment-bearing words, so assign 0 to each.\n\n**Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are preceded or followed by other sentiment-bearing\
    \ words or phrases, so no adjustments are needed.\n\n**Emotion Detection**\n\n\
    * No emotions are explicitly expressed in the text, so no sentiment scores are\
    \ assigned.\n\n**Intensity Analysis**\n\n* No intensity is explicitly expressed\
    \ in the text, so no sentiment scores are assigned.\n\n**Overall Sentiment**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens: -1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = +1\n* Since the overall sentiment\
    \ score is positive, classify the text as \"positive\".\n\nHowever, upon re-reading\
    \ the text, I notice that the sentiment is actually negative. The text expresses\
    \ disappointment and frustration with the small number of engineer troops and\
    \ the lack of preparation for siege warfare. The tone is critical and disapproving.\n\
    \nTherefore, I revise my classification to \"negative\"."
