    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The manner in which\
    \ infantry fights imprints its distinguishing mark on the tactics of an entire\
    \ period; thus, according to the combat formations of infantry, we may speak of\
    \ a period of \u201Clinear,\u201D \u201Ccolumn,\u201D and \u201Cextended order\u201D\
    \ tactics. Infantry can be equipped more cheaply and trained more quickly than\
    \ the other arms. In July, 1870, the French army consisted of 116 infantry regiments\
    \ and 21 rifle battalions, but 38 rifle battalions were raised in addition to\
    \ a large number of regiments of _gardes mobiles_ and volunteers.Infantry is as\
    \ well adapted for combat with firearms as for combat with the bayonet, for attack\
    \ as for defense, for action in close as in extended order. It can fight on any\
    \ terrain which is at all passable, and is more independent of weather and seasons\
    \ than the other arms; it surpasses the other arms in endurance, a man, on account\
    \ of his will power, bearing privations and exertions better than a horse. On\
    \ the other hand, the losses suffered by foot troops in action and through exertions\
    \ on the march are greater than those of the mounted arms.[25][25] Percentages\
    \ of cases of sickness in the campaign 1870/71:Infantry: 69.8; Field Officers:\
    \ 13.26; Captains: 10.19;  Lieutenants: 3.85%  Artillery: 57.7;  \u201E    \u201E\
    \   4.04;   \u201E   4.84;  Lieutenants: 4.52\u201E  Cavalry:  37.5;  \u201E \
    \   \u201E   5.61;   \u201E   2.29;  Lieutenants: 3.24\u201EThe rate of march\
    \ of infantry is so slow that in reconnaissance it can only by great exertions\
    \ attain results which a small force of cavalry would obtain without appreciable\
    \ effort. Infantry acting alone therefore unquestionably requires the assignment\
    \ of mounted men for reconnaissance and messenger duty. As regards reconnaissance,\
    \ infantry is like a man walking in the dark, who can guard against collisions\
    \ only by stretching out his hand and feeling his way.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases that would assign a sentiment score.

    * Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases that would adjust the sentiment score.

    * Emotion Detection: The text does not express any emotions that would assign
    a sentiment score.

    * Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases, there
    is no intensity to analyze.

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.

    * Edge Cases: The text does not contain any edge cases that would affect the classification.


    The text appears to be a historical or technical passage about infantry tactics
    and statistics, and does not express any emotions or opinions that would classify
    it as "positive" or "negative".'
