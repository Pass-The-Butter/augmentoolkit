- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Besides this absolute\
    \ need of method in action, we must also acknowledge that it has a positive advantage,\
    \ which is that, through the constant repetition of a formal exercise, a readiness,\
    \ precision, and firmness is attained in the movement of troops which diminishes\
    \ the natural friction, and makes the machine move easier.Method will therefore\
    \ be the more generally used, become the more indispensable, the farther down\
    \ the scale of rank the position of the active agent; and on the other hand, its\
    \ use will diminish upwards, until in the highest position it quite disappears.\
    \ For this reason it is more in its place in tactics than in strategy.War in its\
    \ highest aspects consists not of an infinite number of little events, the diversities\
    \ in which compensate each other, and which therefore by a better or worse method\
    \ are better or worse governed, but of separate great decisive events which must\
    \ be dealt with separately. It is not like a field of stalks, which, without any\
    \ regard to the particular form of each stalk, will be mowed better or worse,\
    \ according as the mowing instrument is good or bad, but rather as a group of\
    \ large trees, to which the axe must be laid with judgment, according to the particular\
    \ form and inclination of each separate trunk.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Tokenization**\n\n* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n* Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n\n**Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* Found sentiment-bearing words and phrases,\
    \ such as \"positive\", \"readiness\", \"precision\", \"firmness\", \"better\"\
    , \"worse\", \"good\", \"bad\".\n* Assigned sentiment scores:\n\t+ Positive: +1\
    \ (e.g. \"positive\", \"better\", \"good\")\n\t+ Neutral: 0 (e.g. \"readiness\"\
    , \"precision\", \"firmness\")\n\t+ Negative: -1 (e.g. \"worse\", \"bad\")\n\n\
    **Contextual Analysis**\n\n* Adjusted sentiment scores based on context:\n\t+\
    \ \"positive\" is preceded by \"absolute need\", which is neutral, so the sentiment\
    \ score remains +1.\n\t+ \"better\" is preceded by \"more\", which is neutral,\
    \ so the sentiment score remains +1.\n\t+ \"worse\" is preceded by \"diminish\"\
    , which is neutral, so the sentiment score remains -1.\n\n**Emotion Detection**\n\
    \n* Detected emotions: none\n\n**Intensity Analysis**\n\n* Assigned sentiment\
    \ scores based on intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment: +0.5 (e.g. \"better\", \"good\"\
    )\n\t+ Strong sentiment: +1.5 (e.g. \"positive\", \"readiness\")\n\t+ Very strong\
    \ sentiment: +2.5 (none)\n\n**Overall Sentiment**\n\n* Calculated the overall\
    \ sentiment score: +2.5 (positive) - 1.5 (negative) = +1 (neutral)\n\n**Edge Cases**\n\
    \n* The text does not contain any mixed sentiment, sarcasm, or irony.\n\nBased\
    \ on the rules, the overall sentiment of the text is neutral."
