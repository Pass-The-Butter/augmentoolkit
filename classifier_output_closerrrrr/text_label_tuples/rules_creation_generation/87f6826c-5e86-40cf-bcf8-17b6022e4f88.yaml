    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Marshal Saxe remarks,\
    \ that no retreats are so favorable as those which are made before a languid and\
    \ unenterprising enemy, for when he pursues with vigor, the retreat soon degenerates\
    \ into a rout. \u201CUpon this principle it is a great error,\u201D says the marshal,\
    \ \u201Cto adhere to the proverb which recommends us to build a bridge of gold\
    \ for a retreating enemy. No; follow him up with spirit, and he is destroyed!\u201D\
    MAXIM VII.An army should be ready every day, every night, and at all times of\
    \ the day and night, to oppose all the resistance of which it is capable. With\
    \ this view, the soldier should always be furnished completely with arms and ammunition;\
    \ the infantry should never be without its artillery, its cavalry, and its generals;\
    \ and the different divisions of the army should be constantly in a state to support,\
    \ to be supported, and to protect itself.The troops, whether halted, or encamped,\
    \ or on the march, should be always in favorable positions, possessing the essentials\
    \ required for a field of battle; for example, the flanks should be well covered,\
    \ and all the artillery so placed as to have free range, and to play with the\
    \ greatest advantage. When an army is in column of march, it should have advanced\
    \ guards and flanking parties, to examine well the country in front, to the right,\
    \ and to the left, and always at such distance as to enable the main body to deploy\
    \ into position.NOTE.The following maxims, taken from the memoirs of Mont\xE9\
    cuculli, appear to me well suited to this place, and calculated to form a useful\
    \ commentary on the general principles laid down in the preceding maxim:\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.


    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so no sentiment scores are assigned.


    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no context to analyze.


    4. Emotion Detection: There are no emotions expressed in the text, so no sentiment
    scores are assigned.


    5. Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no intensity to analyze.


    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, since there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.


    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a passage of historical or military writing, discussing
    military strategy and tactics. It does not contain any emotional language or sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases, so it is classified as "neutral".'
