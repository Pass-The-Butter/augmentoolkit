    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"The best officers\
    \ and finest soldiers were obliged to sacrifice themselves in a lamentable manner,\
    \ to compensate for the negligence and incapacity of a government, always ready\
    \ to plunge the nation into war, without the slightest care of what was necessary\
    \ to obtain success. The sieges carried on by the British in Spain were a succession\
    \ of butcheries; because the commonest materials, and the means necessary to their\
    \ art, were denied the engineers.\" Colonel J.T. Jones writes in nearly the same\
    \ terms of the early sieges in the Peninsula, and with respect to the siege of\
    \ Badajos, adds in express terms, that \"a body of sappers and miners, and the\
    \ necessary fascines and gabions, would have rendered the reduction of the work\
    \ certain.\"[38] Soon after this siege a body of engineer troops arrived from\
    \ England, but their number was insufficient, and Wellington, having learned by\
    \ sad experience the importance of engineer troops, ordered a body of two hundred\
    \ volunteers to be detached from the line, \"and daily instructed in the practice\
    \ of sapping, making and laying fascines and gabions, and the construction of\
    \ batteries, &c.\" The siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, which immediately followed this\
    \ organization, was conducted with greater skill and success than any other till\
    \ nearly the close of the war; and all military writers have attributed this result\
    \ to the greater efficiency of the engineer force engaged in the siege. This arm\
    \ was now gradually increased, and the last year of the war the engineer force\
    \ with the English army in the field consisted of seventy-seven officers, seven\
    \ assistant-engineers and surveyors, four surgeons and assistants, one thousand\
    \ six hundred and forty-six sappers, miners, artificers, &c., one thousand three\
    \ hundred and forty horses and one hundred and sixty carriages.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n* Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases, such as \"lamentable\", \"negligence\", \"incapacity\", \"butcheries\"\
    , \"sad experience\", \"importance\", and \"greater efficiency\". These words\
    \ and phrases are assigned sentiment scores as follows:\n\t+ \"lamentable\" and\
    \ \"butcheries\" are negative (-1)\n\t+ \"negligence\" and \"incapacity\" are\
    \ negative (-1)\n\t+ \"sad experience\" is negative (-1)\n\t+ \"importance\" is\
    \ neutral (0)\n\t+ \"greater efficiency\" is positive (+1)\n* Contextual Analysis:\
    \ The context of each token is analyzed, and the sentiment scores are adjusted\
    \ accordingly. For example, the token \"sad\" is preceded by \"experience\", which\
    \ is a sentiment-bearing word, so the sentiment score is adjusted to -1 (negative).\n\
    * Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger,\
    \ which are assigned sentiment scores as follows:\n\t+ Sadness: -1 (negative)\n\
    \t+ Fear: -1 (negative)\n\t+ Anger: -1 (negative)\n* Intensity Analysis: The intensity\
    \ of the sentiment-bearing words and phrases is analyzed, and the sentiment scores\
    \ are adjusted accordingly. For example, the phrase \"greater efficiency\" is\
    \ a strong sentiment, so the sentiment score is adjusted to +2.5 (very positive).\n\
    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the\
    \ sentiment scores of all tokens. The score is -4.5, which is negative.\n\nThe\
    \ text is classified as \"negative\" because the overall sentiment score is negative."
