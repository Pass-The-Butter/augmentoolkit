    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"The tide of battle\
    \ is in the hands of each fighter, and never, at any time, has the individual\
    \ bravery of the soldier had more importance.\"Whatever the science of the superior\
    \ commander, the genius of his strategic combinations, the precision of his concentrations,\
    \ whatever numerical superiority he may have, victory will escape him if the soldier\
    \ does not conduct himself without being watched, and if he is not personally\
    \ animated by the resolution to conquer or to perish. He needs much greater energy\
    \ than formerly.\"He no longer has the intoxication of ancient attacks in mass\
    \ to sustain him. Formerly, the terrible anxiety of waiting made him wish for\
    \ the violent blow, dangerous, but soon passed. Now, all his normal and physical\
    \ powers are tried for long hours and, in such a test, he will have but the resoluteness\
    \ of his own heart to sustain him.\"Armies of to-day gain decisions by action\
    \ in open order, where each soldier must act individually with will and initiative\
    \ to attack the enemy and destroy him.\"The Frenchman has always been an excellent\
    \ rifleman, intelligent, adroit and bold. He is naturally brave. The metal is\
    \ good; the problem is to temper it. It must be recognized that to-day this task\
    \ is not easy. The desire for physical comfort, the international theories which\
    \ come therefrom, preferring economic slavery and work for the profit of the stranger\
    \ to the struggle, do not incite the Frenchman to give his life in order to save\
    \ that of his brother.\"The new arms are almost valueless in the hands of weakhearted\
    \ soldiers, no matter what their number may be. On the contrary, the demoralizing\
    \ power of rapid and smokeless firing, which certain armies still persist in not\
    \ acknowledging, manifests itself with so much the more force as each soldier\
    \ possesses greater valor and cool energy.\"\"\""

    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases such
    as "bravery", "resolution", "conquer", "perish", "bold", "brave", "valor", and
    "cool energy", which are assigned a sentiment score of +1 (positive).

    * Contextual Analysis: The text''s context is analyzed, and the sentiment scores

    * Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions such as joy, excitement, and
    bravery, which are assigned a sentiment score of +1 (positive).

    phrase "The desire for physical comfort, the international theories which come
    therefrom, preferring economic slavery and work for the profit of the stranger
    to the struggle, do not incite the Frenchman to give his life in order to save
    that of his brother" is assigned a sentiment score of +0.5 (neutral) due to its
    mild sentiment.

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the
