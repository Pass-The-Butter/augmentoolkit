    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Ambitious men who,\
    \ listening only to their passions, arm natives of the same land against each\
    \ other (under the deceitful pretext of the public good), are still more criminal.\
    \ For however arbitrary a government, the institutions which have been consolidated\
    \ by time, are always preferable to civil war, and to that anarchy which the latter\
    \ is obliged to create for the justification of its crimes.To be faithful to his\
    \ sovereign, and to respect the established government, are the first principles\
    \ which ought to distinguish a soldier and a man of honor.MAXIM LXXII.A general-in-chief\
    \ has no right to shelter his mistakes in war under cover of his sovereign, or\
    \ of a minister, when these are both distant from the scene of operation, and\
    \ must consequently be either ill informed or wholly ignorant of the actual state\
    \ of things.Hence, it follows, that every general is culpable who undertakes the\
    \ execution of a plan which he considers faulty. It is his duty to represent his\
    \ reasons, to insist upon a change of plan, in short, to give in his resignation,\
    \ rather than allow himself to be made the instrument of his army\u2019s ruin.\
    \ Every general-in-chief who fights a battle in consequence of superior orders,\
    \ with the certainty of losing it, is equally blamable.In this last-mentioned\
    \ case, the general ought to refuse obedience; because a blind obedience is due\
    \ only to a military command given by a superior present on the spot at the moment\
    \ of action. Being in possession of the real state of things, the superior has\
    \ it then in his power to afford the necessary explanations to the person who\
    \ executes his orders.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"negative\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and\
    \ phrases, such as \"criminal\", \"preferable\", \"anarchy\", \"crimes\", \"faulty\"\
    , \"blamable\", and \"ruin\". These words and phrases are assigned sentiment scores:\n\
    \t* \"criminal\" and \"crimes\" are negative (-1)\n\t* \"preferable\" and \"good\"\
    \ are positive (+1)\n\t* \"anarchy\" and \"ruin\" are negative (-1)\n\t* \"faulty\"\
    \ and \"blamable\" are negative (-1)\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each\
    \ token is analyzed, and the sentiment scores are adjusted accordingly. For example,\
    \ the token \"faulty\" is preceded by \"a plan which he considers\", which is\
    \ a negative context, so the sentiment score is adjusted to -1.\n4. Emotion Detection:\
    \ The text expresses emotions such as anger, frustration, and disappointment,\
    \ which are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Anger and frustration are negative\
    \ (-1)\n\t* Disappointment is negative (-1)\n5. Intensity Analysis: The intensity\
    \ of the sentiment-bearing words and phrases is analyzed, and the sentiment scores\
    \ are adjusted accordingly. For example, the token \"criminal\" is a strong sentiment,\
    \ so it is assigned a sentiment score of -2.\n6. Overall Sentiment: The overall\
    \ sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of all tokens.\
    \ The score is:\n\t* -1 (criminal) + 1 (preferable) - 1 (anarchy) - 1 (crimes)\
    \ - 1 (faulty) - 1 (blamable) = -4\n\t* Since the overall sentiment score is negative,\
    \ the text is classified as \"negative\".\n\nThe text expresses strong negative\
    \ sentiments, criticizing the actions of ambitious men who cause civil war and\
    \ anarchy, and blaming generals who follow faulty plans and ignore the consequences."
