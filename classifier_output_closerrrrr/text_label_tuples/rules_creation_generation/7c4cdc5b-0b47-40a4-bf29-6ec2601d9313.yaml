- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"It depends upon\
    \ the situation whether the troops intended for the holding attack finally participate\
    \ in the assault itself. If they can bring an effective fire to bear upon the\
    \ point of attack from an oblique direction and thereby ensure the success of\
    \ the attack, they should make the most of this advantage. (Par. 340 German I.\
    \ D. R.).When the enemy advances to the frontal counter-attack, as laid down in\
    \ the Russian and British regulations, the skirmishers throw themselves down for\
    \ the purpose of firing. The supports in the act of moving up continue their march.\
    \ If the enemy faces about, all the troops press after him.The French regulations\
    \ (par. 270) also consider such a counter-attack:\u201CIf the attacker presses\
    \ forward too hastily and if he threatens  to carry the defender\u2019s position,\
    \ fresh troops, which have been  assembled in a place sheltered from view, attack\
    \ him energetically,  while the troops already engaged increase the intensity\
    \ of their  fire. This powerful and energetic counter-attack produces confusion\
    \  in the enemy\u2019s ranks and compels him to retire, or at least to  discontinue\
    \ his forward movement until he has had time to recover....  The troops in the\
    \ counter-attack should move forward without  hesitation and regardless of the\
    \ cost. When such a forward movement  has to be discontinued, the commander must\
    \ decide where it shall  cease. The efforts of all should be directed toward one\
    \ object, that  of tiring and demoralizing the enemy by constant counter-attacks,\
    \  until the moment arrives when the commander must order the offensive  to be\
    \ assumed.\u201D\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so no sentiment scores are assigned.

    * Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    no adjustments are made to the sentiment scores.

    * Emotion Detection: No emotions are expressed in the text, so no sentiment scores
    are assigned.

    * Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases, no
    intensity scores are assigned.

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases in the text.

    * Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a passage from a military manual or strategy guide, discussing
    tactics and counter-attacks. It does not express any emotions or opinions, and
    therefore is classified as "neutral".'
