- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"During the battle\
    \ of =Scheinovo=, three companies of the 11th Russian  Rifle Regiment made an\
    \ unsuccessful attack and had to retreat under  the pursuing fire of the Turks,\
    \ while Turkish cavalry began to  charge their left flank. When only 200-300 m.\
    \ from the Turks, the  4th Company, which was most seriously threatened, halted\
    \ and formed  square as if on the parade ground. During this maneuver, all the\
    \  officers and many non-commissioned officers were either killed or  wounded.\
    \ The heavy losses of the battalion (50%) may, in the main, be  ascribed to this\
    \ halt under the most violent fire of the enemy.[305][305] KUROPATKIN-KRAHMER,\
    \ _Kritische R\xFCckblicke auf den  Russisch-T\xFCrkischen Krieg_, I, p. 166.When\
    \ the cavalry charge comes more from the front, however, the hostile infantry\
    \ and artillery will have to stop firing, and it may then be possible to rally\
    \ or re-form the defeated force, provided the men will heed their leaders.Units\
    \ in close order can deploy quickly toward the front or flank for the purpose\
    \ of firing. However, they will be able to fire in close order only when not themselves\
    \ subjected to hostile fire. The front and flanks of a body of infantry in proper\
    \ formation are equally strong, but, in this connection, it should be borne in\
    \ mind that a deployment toward a flank, for the purpose of firing, always takes\
    \ time and is apt to impair the steadiness of the men.[306]\"\"\""
