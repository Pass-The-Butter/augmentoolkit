    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"At the same time\
    \ Pompey's entire cavalry dashed from the left wing, as had been ordered, and\
    \ the mass of his archers ran from all parts of the line. Our cavalry did not\
    \ await the charge, but fell back a little. Pompey's cavalry became more pressing,\
    \ and commenced to reform its squadrons and turn our exposed flank. As soon as\
    \ Caesar saw this intention, he gave the signal to the fourth line of six cohorts.\
    \ This line started directly and, standards low, they charged the Pompeian cavalry\
    \ with such vigor and resolution that not a single man stood his ground. All wheeled\
    \ about and not only withdrew in full flight, but gained the highest mountains\
    \ as fast as they could. They left the archers and slingers without their defense\
    \ and protection. These were all killed. At the same time the cohorts moved to\
    \ the rear of Pompey's left wing, which was still fighting and resisting, and\
    \ attacked it in rear.\"Meanwhile, Caesar had advanced his third line, which up\
    \ to this moment had been kept quietly at its post. These fresh troops relieved\
    \ those that were fatigued. Pompey's men, taken in rear, could no longer hold\
    \ out and all took to flight.\"Caesar was not in error when he put these cohorts\
    \ in a fourth line, particularly charged with meeting the cavalry, and urged them\
    \ to do well, since their effort would bring victory. They repulsed the cavalry.\
    \ They cut to pieces the slingers and archers. They turned Pompey's left wing,\
    \ and this decided the day.\"\"\""
