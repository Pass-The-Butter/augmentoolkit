    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"1st. That our\
    \ system of permanent coast defences is a wise and  proper one, which ought to\
    \ be completed and armed with the least  possible delay.\"\"2d. That mere individual\
    \ courage cannot suffice to overcome the  forces that would be brought against\
    \ us, were we involved in an European  war, but that it must be rendered manageable\
    \ by discipline, and  directed by that consummate and mechanical skill which can\
    \ only be  acquired by a course of education, instituted for the special purpose,\
    \  and by long habit.\"\"In the day of sailing-vessels the successful siege of\
    \ Sebastopol  would have been impossible. It is evident that the Russians did\
    \ not  appreciate the advantages afforded by steamers, and were unprepared  to\
    \ sustain a siege.\"\"This same power of steam would enable European nations to\
    \ disembark  upon our shores even a larger force than that which finally encamped\
    \  around Sebastopol. To resist such an attack, should it ever be  made, our cities\
    \ and harbors must be fortified, and those fortifications  must be provided with\
    \ guns, ammunition, and instructed artillerists.  To repel the advance of such\
    \ an army into the interior, it is not enough  to trust to the number of brave\
    \ but undisciplined men that we can  bring to bear against it. An invading army\
    \ of 15,000 or 20,000 men  could easily be crushed by the unremitting attacks\
    \ of superior numbers;  but when it comes to the case of more than 100,000 disciplined\
    \  veterans, the very multitude brought to bear against them works its  own destruction;\
    \ because, if without discipline and instruction, they  cannot be handled, and\
    \ are in their own way. We cannot afford a Moscow  campaign.\"\"\"\""
