    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"=1. Its military\
    \ beginnings, its increasing importance.= At the beginning of the war, Germany\
    \ alone possessed a military flying corps. She was the only nation who desired\
    \ war. She was the only one prepared, in this as in other respects. Her foresight\
    \ was duly rewarded.Though still few, her aviators found themselves the masters\
    \ of the air. They made themselves very useful to the German Command by observations\
    \ that enabled them to locate the principal French forces. They rendered also\
    \ great services to their artillery during the actual fighting. A German machine,\
    \ while clumsily flying some 3000 feet above the French batteries, would send\
    \ up a rocket, and a few minutes afterwards 150 mm. shells would begin to fall\
    \ on the spot thus indicated.If, at the time, the Germans had been as expert as\
    \ they are now in pointing their guns, these air-directed bombardments would have\
    \ had more efficacious results, but even as it was, they invariably produced a\
    \ deplorable impression on the morale of the troops who felt themselves at the\
    \ mercy of a shell-fire which the French artillery could not return for want of\
    \ howitzers.Aviation had developed itself mostly among the civilians in France.\
    \ Overnight, as it were, our civilians became military aviators. They showed great\
    \ bravery and a few at once proved themselves remarkable. Their machines, though\
    \ speedy, as speed was reckoned in those days, were in many ways inadequate for\
    \ the purposes of war, but they were none the less extremely effective.Since 1914,\
    \ all the belligerents have, with more or less success, considerably developed\
    \ the scope of their aviation.In France there was too much indecision as to what\
    \ types should be adopted.The production of standardized machines encountered\
    \ serious difficulties. Construction was slow. Factories either lacked machinery\
    \ entirely or were insufficiently supplied with it.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", etc. are removed.


    **Sentiment Analysis**: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "good",
    "great", "remarkable", but also words with negative connotations like "deplorable",
    "inadequate". The sentiment scores are:


    * "good", "great", "remarkable": +1 (positive)

    * "deplorable", "inadequate": -1 (negative)


    **Contextual Analysis**: The context of the text is mostly descriptive, providing
    historical information about the development of aviation during World War I. There
    are no sentiment-bearing phrases that would significantly impact the sentiment
    score.


    **Emotion Detection**: The text does not express emotions like joy, sadness, anger,
    etc.


    **Intensity Analysis**: The sentiment-bearing words and phrases have a moderate
    intensity, neither extremely strong nor weak.


    **Overall Sentiment**: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the positive
    and negative sentiment scores balance each other out.


    **Edge Cases**: The text does not contain any edge cases that would significantly
    impact the classification.


    Overall, the text is neutral, providing factual information about the development
    of aviation during World War I without expressing a clear positive or negative
    sentiment.'
