- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"THE NECESSITY FOR\
    \ STUDY.--It is not pretended by any sane writer that study alone will make a\
    \ perfect officer, for it is universally recognised that no amount of theoretical\
    \ training can supply the knowledge gained by direct and immediate association\
    \ with troops in the field; nor is it claimed that study will make a dull man\
    \ brilliant, or confer resolution and rapid decision on one who is timid and irresolute\
    \ by nature. But \"the quick, {5} the resolute, the daring, deciding and acting\
    \ rapidly, as is their nature, will be all the more likely to decide and act correctly\
    \ in proportion as they have studied the art they are called upon to practise\"\
    \ (\"The Science of War\"). Theory, applied to the profession of arms, is to some\
    \ a word of most obnoxious sound, but it is obnoxious only to those who refuse\
    \ to listen to the advice, or to take warning from the practice, of Napoleon,\
    \ of Wellington, of Foch, and of many of the most famous generals of history.\
    \ \"A man thoroughly penetrated with the spirit of Napoleon's warfare would hardly\
    \ fail in all circumstances to make his enemy's communications his first objective;\
    \ and if Wellington's tactical methods had become a second nature to him it would\
    \ be strange indeed if he were seduced into delivering a purely frontal attack.\
    \ . . . The same tactical principles regulate the combat of a large force and\
    \ a small, and it is the thorough grasp of the principles, combined with courage\
    \ and coolness, that makes a capable leader, whether of a platoon or an army corps\"\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"neutral\".\n\n\
    Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words\
    \ and punctuation marks are removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains\
    \ sentiment-bearing words and phrases, such as \"perfect\", \"dull\", \"brilliant\"\
    , \"resolute\", \"daring\", \"correctly\", \"obnoxious\", \"penetrated\", \"spirit\"\
    , \"courage\", and \"coolness\". These words have sentiment scores assigned to\
    \ them:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g. \"perfect\", \"brilliant\", \"resolute\", \"daring\"\
    , \"correctly\", \"courage\", \"coolness\")\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g. \"study\", \"\
    theory\", \"profession\", \"arms\", \"Napoleon\", \"Wellington\", \"Foch\", \"\
    history\")\n\t* Negative: -1 (e.g. \"dull\", \"obnoxious\")\n3. Contextual Analysis:\
    \ The text's context is analyzed by looking at the surrounding tokens. For example,\
    \ the token \"dull\" is preceded by \"no amount of theoretical training can supply\
    \ the knowledge gained by direct and immediate association with troops in the\
    \ field\", which adjusts its sentiment score to +0.5 (neutral).\n4. Emotion Detection:\
    \ The text expresses emotions such as confidence, courage, and coolness, which\
    \ are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t\
    * Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n5. Intensity Analysis: The text's intensity\
    \ is analyzed by looking at the strength of the sentiment-bearing words and phrases.\
    \ For example, the phrase \"the quick, the resolute, the daring, deciding and\
    \ acting rapidly\" has a strong sentiment score of +1.5 (positive).\n6. Overall\
    \ Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of all tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating a neutral sentiment.\n\
    \nGiven the neutral sentiment score, I classify the input text as \"neutral\"."
