    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"On ground rising\
    \ in respect to the line of sight (_i.e._, on the  slope of heights facing the\
    \ enemy, or opposite to commanding ground,  the slope facing the plain) columns\
    \ suffer the greatest losses; on  ground falling in respect to the line of sight\
    \ (on the reverse slope  of hills and on plateaus) line targets suffer the greatest\
    \ losses.Where the ground falls at a greater angle than the angle of fall of \
    \ the projectiles (about 5 degrees at 1500 m., and 1 degree at 800  m.) a defiladed\
    \ space is formed, which makes it possible to bring  supports nearer to the firing\
    \ line than would be practicable on level  ground. If we assume that each graduation\
    \ of the rear sight over 600  m. commands a space 100 m. deep with the normal\
    \ core of hits, we  obtain the following depths of the beaten zones at a range\
    \ of 1500  m., with rifle model \u201998 (angle of fall 5 degrees and 22 minutes):Ground\
    \ rising  1 in 10 = 6\xB0 = 50 m.   \u201E   \u201E   1 in 20 = 3\xB0 = 64 m.\
    \   \u201E   \u201E   1 in 50 = 1\xB0 = 81 m.  Ground falling 1 in 10 = 6\xB0\
    \ = 360 m.   \u201E   \u201E   1 in 20 = 3\xB0 = 180 m.   \u201E   \u201E   1\
    \ in 50 = 1\xB0 = 113 m.[Illustration][Illustration]The figures on pages 181 and\
    \ 182 show to what extent the ground is  capable of increasing or diminishing\
    \ the efficacy of fire. The French  assert that the W\xFCrtembergers deliberately\
    \ applied these principles  in the defense of the park wall at =Villiers=. It\
    \ was, at any rate,  only an accident that the masses of troops on the west side\
    \ of the  gently sloping Mamelon de Villiers suffered heavy losses on November\
    \  30th, 1870.\"\"\""
