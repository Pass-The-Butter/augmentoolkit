    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"But, as every thing\
    \ depends upon the strength of the army and of the units of which it is composed,\

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the
    text.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since no sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found,
    there is no context to analyze.

    4. Emotion Detection: No emotions are expressed in the text.

    5. Intensity Analysis: Since no sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found,
    there is no intensity to analyze.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, as there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases in the text.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases.


    The text appears to be a technical description of military formations and does
    not express any emotions or sentiments. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
