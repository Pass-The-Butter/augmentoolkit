- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The rallying position\
    \ should be occupied in time, so that all dispositions for holding it can be made\
    \ calmly and without precipitation. A powerful fire at mid and long ranges is\
    \ requisite to prevent the enemy from reaching decisive ranges. The firing line\
    \ should, therefore, be strong and the supports weak. If a reserve is still available,\
    \ it is at once sent back into a second rallying position, to cover the withdrawal\
    \ of the troops occupying the first rallying position. A free field of fire down\
    \ to the shortest ranges is not necessary. If the position is on elevated ground,\
    \ the firing line should be posted so far in rear of the crest that, while its\
    \ fire can still sweep the ground at mid ranges, and perhaps at the extreme limit\
    \ of short ranges, the skirmishers, on retiring, will be sheltered as soon as\
    \ possible. Fire should be opened as soon as possible, in order to retard the\
    \ enemy\u2019s advance.The troops holding a rallying position should delay the\
    \ enemy\u2019s advance long enough to give the retiring force ample time and room\
    \ to re-form, so that it can effect its retreat in good order. When this has been\
    \ accomplished, the troops occupying the rallying position retire, unless there\
    \ is hope that fresh troops may bring about a change in the state of affairs.\
    \ As a rule, a second rallying position will be necessary, but it would be a mistake\
    \ to halt in every seemingly favorable position. When a retreat has once been\
    \ decided upon, it is generally necessary to get away from the enemy as quickly\
    \ as possible.\"\"\""

    **Contextual Analysis**: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases that would adjust the sentiment score.


    **Emotion Detection**: The text does not express emotions such as joy, sadness,
    fear, or anger.


    **Intensity Analysis**: The text does not contain strong sentiment-bearing words
    or phrases that would assign a sentiment score.
