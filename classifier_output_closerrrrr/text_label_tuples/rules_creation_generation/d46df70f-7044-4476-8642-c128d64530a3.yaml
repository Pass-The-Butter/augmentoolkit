- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"OCCUPATION OF A\
    \ DEFENSIVE POSITION.--The framework of the _defence_ is provided by artillery\
    \ and machine-gun fire; the backbone of the _offence_ is the infantry. The Commander\
    \ will _divide the troops_ into (a) _Troops to hold the position_, and (b) _General\
    \ Reserve_, the golden rule being to make (a) as small as the tactical situation\
    \ permits in order that (b) may be as large as possible, and its work absolutely\
    \ decisive. Under no circumstances {92} should the General Reserve be much below\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * Split the text into individual words or tokens.

    * The resulting tokens are: ["OCCUPATION", "OF", "A", "DEFENSIVE", "POSITION",
    "The", "framework", "of", "the", "defence", "is", "provided", "by", "artillery",
    "and", "machine-gun", "fire", "the", "backbone", "of", "the", "offence", "is",
    "the", "infantry", "The", "Commander", "will", "divide", "the", "troops", "into",
    "(a)", "Troops", "to", "hold", "the", "position", "and", "(b)", "General", "Reserve",
    "the", "golden", "rule", "being", "to", "make", "(a)", "as", "small", "as", "the",
    "tactical", "situation", "permits", "in", "order", "that", "(b)", "may", "be",
    "as", "large", "as", "possible", "and", "its", "work", "absolutely", "decisive",
    "Under", "no", "circumstances", "should", "the", "General", "Reserve", "be", "much",
    "below", "half", "the", "available", "force"]
