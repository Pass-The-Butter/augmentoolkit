- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"ARMOURED MOTOR-CARS.\
    \ On some armoured motor-cars small cannon are used; on others, machine-guns are\
    \ placed. They are intended to throw the enemy lines into confusion at certain\
    \ points. Their action must be swift, sudden, and brief. Their mobility enables\
    \ them to dodge the fire of the enemy\u2019s artillery. These cars can be much\
    \ more useful in open field operations than in trench warfare. They will be especially\
    \ useful as a help to cavalry when the latter can once more be used.Every regiment\
    \ of infantry is now provided with a section of three 37 mm. guns which being\
    \ light, easy to move, and very accurate are employed principally, either all\
    \ together or in the proportion of one to each battalion, against machine-guns.\
    \ They have been greatly appreciated by the regiment commanders; a large number\
    \ will probably be distributed as soon as they can be manufactured.=5. Advance\
    \ or withdrawal of the artillery.= One of the most interesting questions for an\
    \ army in the making, such as the American Army, is that of the rapid moving of\
    \ the heavy artillery, at a given moment.We do not hesitate to say that this problem\
    \ is far from being entirely solved on the Western Front, and that its study and\
    \ organization will be a very hard task for the engineers entrusted with its solution.American\
    \ engineers will have to go to the Western Front and see for themselves all the\
    \ difficulties to be surmounted.ADVANCE. During the spring of 1917, the French\
    \ Army had to pursue on a large front an enemy who had not only devastated the\
    \ country behind them to a depth of from 30 to 35 kilometres, but had also accumulated\
    \ in this wilderness all the obstacles their fertile imagination could suggest.The\
    \ 75 mm. field artillery alone, at the cost of great efforts and tremendous loss\
    \ of horses, managed to overtake, though somewhat late, the advance of our infantry,\
    \ which had succeeded in going forward everywhere.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words and punctuation marks
    are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "confusion", "swift", "sudden",
    "brief", "useful", "appreciated", "difficult", and "hard", which are neutral in
    sentiment. There are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would indicate
    a strong positive or negative sentiment.

    * Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases that would be preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase.

    * Emotion Detection: The text does not express any emotions like joy, sadness,
    anger, etc.

    * Intensity Analysis: The text does not contain any strong sentiment-bearing words
    or phrases that would indicate a strong positive or negative sentiment.

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text does
    not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would indicate a strong
    positive or negative sentiment.


    The text appears to be a factual description of military operations and tactics,
    without expressing any emotional or evaluative language. Therefore, I classify
    the text as "neutral".'
