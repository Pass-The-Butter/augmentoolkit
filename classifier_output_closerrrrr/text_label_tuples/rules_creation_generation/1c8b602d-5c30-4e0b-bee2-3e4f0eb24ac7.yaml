- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"(5) On the two\
    \ chief points in connexion with field artillery, records hitherto received tell\
    \ us little. We shall not know until more detailed accounts are available whether\
    \ the vastly superior rapidity of fire enjoyed by the French 75 millimetre gun\
    \ has given it a corresponding superiority over its opponent, the German 77. That\
    \ it has a superiority is fairly clear. The degree of that superiority we shall\
    \ not learn until we have the story of the war from the German side.Neither are\
    \ we established upon the question of weight. General Langlois\u2019 theory, which\
    \ convinced the French that the light gun was essential, has not so far been proved\
    \ absolutely certain, and there have been occasions when the English heavier gun\
    \ (notably at Meaux) was of vast importance to our Allies. But I suggest that\
    \ this question will be better answered now the weather has changed. In dry weather,\
    \ that is, over hard ground, the difference between the heavier and the lighter\
    \ gun is not so noticeable; once the ground is heavy it becomes very noticeable\
    \ indeed.(6) With the next question, that of the materials and their supply, we\
    \ enter a region of the utmost interest to this country in particular, because\
    \ it is the superiority of this country at sea, and the almost complete blockade\
    \ of the Germanic Powers, that is here concerned. Roughly speaking, we find (_a_)\
    \ That a blockade of enemy ports from a great distance is easy; (_b_) of enemy\
    \ supply _through neutrals_ very difficult indeed; (_c_) That certain special\
    \ products which modern science has made necessary in war are most affected. For\
    \ example:\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so no sentiment score is assigned to any tokens.

    * Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no context to analyze.

    * Emotion Detection: No emotions are expressed in the text, so no sentiment score
    is assigned.

    * Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases, there
    is no intensity to analyze.

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, since no sentiment scores
    were assigned to any tokens.

    * Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a factual report or analysis of military artillery, discussing
    technical aspects and statistics. It does not express any emotions or opinions,
    and therefore is classified as "neutral".'
