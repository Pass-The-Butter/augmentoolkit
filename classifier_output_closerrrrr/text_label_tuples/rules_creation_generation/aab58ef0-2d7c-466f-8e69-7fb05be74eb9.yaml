- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"War is only a part\
    \ of policy, a continuance of the previous negotiations; but the instrument is\
    \ now the sword and not the pen. As Clausewitz says, \"_In one word, the art of\
    \ war, in its highest point of view, is policy; but no doubt a policy which fights\
    \ battles instead of writing notes._\" War is merely a means whereby a nation\
    \ attempts to impose its will upon another nation in order to attain a political\
    \ object. This object is settled by policy, which also orders the war, determines\
    \ what sort of war it is to be, with what means and resources and expenditure\
    \ it is to be waged, when its object has been attained, and when it is to cease.\
    \ In fact, policy prepares, leads up to, orders, supports, guides, and stops the\
    \ war. As Clausewitz said, \"_All the leading outlines of a war are always determined\
    \ by the Cabinet--that is, by a political, not a military functionary._\"Unity\
    \ of thought is only to be obtained by \"the conception that war is only a part\
    \ of political intercourse, therefore by no means an independent thing in itself.\"\
    \ \"And how can we conceive it to be otherwise? Does the cessation of diplomatic\
    \ notes stop the political relations between different nations and governments?\
    \ Is not war merely another kind of writing and language for political thoughts?\"\
    \ \"Accordingly war can never be separated from political intercourse; and if,\
    \ in the consideration of the matter, this is done in any way, all the threads\
    \ of the different relations are, to a certain extent, broken, and we have before\
    \ us a senseless thing without an object.\"\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classify the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases,
    such as "war", "policy", "impose", "attain", "object", "prepare", "lead", "support",
    "guide", and "stop". However, these words and phrases are not inherently positive
    or negative, and their sentiment is context-dependent.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text discusses the relationship between war and policy,
    and how policy determines the nature and outcome of war. This context suggests
    that the text is more analytical and neutral than emotional or opinionated.

    4. Emotion Detection: The text does not express emotions such as joy, sadness,
    fear, or anger.

    5. Intensity Analysis: The text does not contain strong sentiment-bearing words
    or phrases, and the language is formal and objective.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text does
    not express a clear positive or negative sentiment.


    Edge Cases: The text does not contain sarcasm or irony, and it does not have mixed
    sentiment. It is a neutral, analytical text that discusses the relationship between
    war and policy.'
