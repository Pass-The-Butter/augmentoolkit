- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"But the results\
    \ of the experimental firing at the remnant of the  fort, which, unless the previous\
    \ firing of the ships during the attack  was absolutely harmless, must have been\
    \ somewhat damaged, and moreover  shaken by the blowing-up of the contiguous portions,\
    \ do not warrant  this conclusion, even should the attacking ships be permitted,\
    \ like  the _Edinburgh_, to take up, quietly and coolly, positions within 500\
    \  yards, and then deliberately commence and continue their firing, without  being\
    \ fired at! The firing of the _Edinburgh_, at 1,060 yards, was  unsatisfactory.\
    \ 390 shot and shells were fired, from the largest and  most powerful guns in\
    \ the British navy (viz., from the Lancaster gun  of 95 cwt., with an elongated\
    \ shell of 100 lbs.;--from 68-pounders of 95  cwt., and 32-pounders of 56 cwt.,\
    \ solid shot guns;--from 10-inch shell  guns of 84 cwt., with hollow shot of 84\
    \ lbs.;--from 8-inch shell guns of  65 and 60 cwt., with hollow shot of 56 lbs.),\
    \ and did but little injury  to the work. At 480 yards, 250 shot, shells, and\
    \ hollow shot were fired.  A small breach was formed in the facing of the outer\
    \ wall, of extremely  bad masonry, and considerable damage done to the embrasures\
    \ and  other portions of the wall; but no decisive result was obtained--no  practicable\
    \ breach formed, by which the work might be assaulted,  taken, and effectually\
    \ destroyed, although 640 shot and shells (40,000  lbs. of metal) were fired into\
    \ the place, first at 1,060, and then at  480 yards.\"Surely, this \"naval attack,\"\
    \ taken in connection with the true facts of the capture of Kinburn, the abortive\
    \ attempt of the British fleet in the Pacific upon the Russian works of Petropauloski,\
    \ is not calculated to affect the well established opinion of the ability of forts\
    \ to resist maritime attacks.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    * Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    * Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases such
    as "unsatisfactory", "bad", "little injury", "considerable damage", and "not calculated
    to affect the well established opinion of the ability of forts to resist maritime
    attacks". These words and phrases are assigned a sentiment score of -1 (negative).

    * Contextual Analysis: The text provides context for the sentiment-bearing words
    and phrases. For example, the phrase "unsatisfactory" is used to describe the
    firing of the Edinburgh, which is preceded by the phrase "do not warrant this
    conclusion". This adjusts the sentiment score of the word "unsatisfactory" to
    -1 (negative).

    * Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions such as disappointment, frustration,
    and skepticism. These emotions are assigned a sentiment score of -1 (negative).

    * Intensity Analysis: The text uses strong sentiment-bearing words and phrases
    such as "bad", "considerable damage", and "not calculated to affect". These words
    and phrases are assigned a sentiment score of -1.5 (negative) or -2.5 (very negative).

    * Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the
    sentiment scores of all tokens. The score is predominantly negative, indicating
    that the text is classified as "negative".


    Edge Cases: The text does not contain any edge cases that would affect the classification.'
