    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"If every army were\
    \ a solid mass, capable of motion as a unit under the influence of one man's will\
    \ and as rapidly as thought, the art of winning battles would be reduced to choosing\
    \ the most favorable order of battle, and a general could reckon with certainty\
    \ upon the success of maneuvers arranged beforehand. But the facts are altogether\
    \ different; for the great difficulty of the tactics of battles will always be\
    \ to render certain the simultaneous entering into action of the numerous fractions\
    \ whose efforts must combine to make such an attack as will give good ground to\
    \ hope for victory: in other words, the chief difficulty is to cause these fractions\
    \ to unite in the execution of the decisive maneuver which, in accordance with\
    \ the original plan of the battle, is to result in victory.Inaccurate transmission\
    \ of orders, the manner in which they will be understood and executed by the subordinates\
    \ of the general-in-chief, excess of activity in some, lack of it in others, a\
    \ defective _coup-d'oeil militaire_,--every thing of this kind may interfere with\
    \ the simultaneous entering into action of the different parts, without speaking\
    \ of the accidental circumstances which may delay or prevent the arrival of a\
    \ corps at the appointed place.\"\"\""

    or phrases that would immediately indicate a positive or negative sentiment.


    **Contextual Analysis**: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words
    or phrases that would adjust the sentiment score.


    **Emotion Detection**: The text does not express any emotions that would assign
    a sentiment score.


    **Intensity Analysis**: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no intensity to analyze.


    **Overall Sentiment**: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are no
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases to contribute to a positive or negative score.


    **Edge Cases**: The text does not contain any mixed sentiment, sarcasm, or irony,
