- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"Salle's division\
    \ to which the Trochu brigade belonged, and in which my brother served, was charged\
    \ with the attack on the central bastion. This operation was considered a simple\
    \ diversion without a chance of success. My brother, commanding the storming column\
    \ of his battalion, had the good fortune to come out safe and sound from the deadly\
    \ fire to which he was exposed and which deprived the battalion of several good\
    \ officers. He entered the bastion with a dozen men. All were naturally made prisoners\
    \ after a resistance which would have cost my brother his life if the bugler at\
    \ his side had not warded off a saber blow at his head. Upon his return from captivity,\
    \ in the first months of 1856, he was immediately made major in the 100th Regiment\
    \ of the Line, at the instance of General Trochu who regarded him highly. He was\
    \ called the following year to the command of the 16th Battalion of Foot Chasseurs.\
    \ He served with this battalion during the Syrian campaign where there was but\
    \ little serious action.\"Back again in France, his promotion to the grade of\
    \ lieutenant-colonel, notwithstanding his excellent ratings and his place on the\
    \ promotion list, was long retarded by the ill-will of Marshal Randon, the Minister\
    \ of War. Marshal Randon complained of his independent character and bore him\
    \ malice from an incident relative to the furnishing of shoes intended for his\
    \ battalion. My brother, questioned by Marshal Niel about the quality of the lot\
    \ of shoes, had frankly declared it bad.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like "good",
    "safe", "sound", "fortunate", "highly", etc. These words are assigned a sentiment
    score of +1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing phrases
    or words that would adjust the sentiment score.

    4. Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions like "joy" and "relief" (e.g.,
    "he was safe and sound"), but these emotions are not strong enough to assign a
    sentiment score.

    5. Intensity Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words in the text are not particularly
    strong or intense, so they are assigned a sentiment score of +0.5 (neutral).

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up
    the sentiment scores of all tokens. Since the scores are mostly neutral, the overall
    sentiment score is also neutral.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any edge cases that would affect the
    classification.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain strong
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases, and the emotions expressed are not intense
    or dominant.'
