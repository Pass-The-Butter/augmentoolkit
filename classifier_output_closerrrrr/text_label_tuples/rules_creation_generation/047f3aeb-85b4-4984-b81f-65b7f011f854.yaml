- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In winter campaigns,\
    \ when wheel and horse cannot be used, recourse is had to the Canadian snowshoe\
    \ (a web shoe) or to the Norwegian snowshoe or ski (skee). In France, Italy, Austria,[31]\
    \ Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland marching on snowshoes is assiduously practiced,\
    \ while in Germany the troops have so far done little in this line. The ski is,\
    \ however, coming more and more into vogue among the rural population of the German\
    \ mountains.[31] One of the most remarkable snowshoe marches ever recorded is\
    \  without doubt that made by the ski detachment of the 4th Regiment  of Tirolese\
    \ Kaiser-J\xE4gers (Austria) stationed in Salzburg. In  June, 1905, this detachment,\
    \ consisting of 4 officers, 15 men and  4 guides, all with field equipment, marched\
    \ around the base of the  \u201CGrosz Glockner,\u201D via Mittersil, Felber-Tauern\
    \ (elev. 2,500 m.),  Windisch-Matrey, Lienz, Dolsack, Hochtor (elev. 2,570 m.),\
    \ into the  Fuscher valley, despite violent cyclonic snow storms, a journey  which,\
    \ even in mid-summer, can only be undertaken by experienced  tourists. In several\
    \ of these detachments experiments were made with  white covers for uniform and\
    \ equipment, which enabled individual men  and patrols to approach unseen to within\
    \ 200 to 300 m. of an opponent.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * The text is split into individual words or tokens.

    * No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the text.

    * No emotions are detected in the text.


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the text, so no adjustments
