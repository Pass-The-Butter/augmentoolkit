    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"If the fire power\
    \ of the firing line is to be maintained after heavy losses, or the intensity\
    \ of its fire is to be augmented, or when it finally is to receive the impulse\
    \ for making a further advance, it must be reinforced. (Pars. 226, 227 and 341\
    \ German I. D. R.). This may be done by prolonging the line (platoons abreast\
    \ at well defined intervals), or, when space is lacking and after losses have\
    \ occurred, by putting men in the intervals (_i.e._, increasing the density of\
    \ the line and filling it up). When the firing line is prolonged, tactical units\
    \ are not broken up, and this facilitates fire control. Whenever practicable,\
    \ the firing line should be reinforced by prolonging it, although the other method,\
    \ that of placing men in the intervals and gaps of the firing line, is more frequently\
    \ used and more practical because the arrival of fresh men and the replacement\
    \ of incapacitated officers occasioned thereby renews the strength of the firing\
    \ line (replenishment of ammunition). The breaking up of platoons is unavoidable,\
    \ and on that account platoon and squad leaders should be trained in time of peace\
    \ to form new units at once so that control is not lost. In order to prevent the\
    \ mixing of units, so far as this is possible, and to keep the firing line filled\
    \ up with skirmishers, even during an engagement entailing heavy losses, it is\
    \ indispensable that the fighting front should be limited, that of a company in\
    \ attack to 150, in defense to about 200 m. The unit designated to reinforce the\
    \ firing line endeavors to approach that line under cover, forms skirmish line\
    \ at any rate before leaving the last cover and advances by rushes, or, if directly\
    \ in rear of the firing line and under a heavy fire, even by crawling.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases, so no sentiment scores are assigned.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no context to analyze.

    4. Emotion Detection: No emotions are expressed in the text, so no sentiment scores
    are assigned.

    5. Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no intensity to analyze.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, since there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a technical description of military tactics and strategies,
    and does not express any emotions or opinions. Therefore, it is classified as
    "neutral".'
