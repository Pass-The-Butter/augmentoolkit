- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Jomini speaks of\
    \ charges at a trot against cavalry at a gallop. He cites Lasalle who used the\
    \ trot and who, seeing cavalry approach at a gallop, would say: \"There are lost\
    \ men.\" Jomini insists on the effect of shock. The trot permits that compactness\
    \ which the gallop breaks up. That may be true. But the effect is moral above\
    \ all. A troop at the gallop sees a massed squadron coming towards it at a trot.\
    \ It is surprised at first at such coolness. The material impulse of the gallop\
    \ is superior; but there are no intervals, no gaps through which to penetrate\
    \ the line in order to avoid the shock, the shock that overcomes men and horses.\
    \ These men must be very resolute, as their close ranks do not permit them to\
    \ escape by about facing. If they move at such a steady gait, it is because their\
    \ resolution is also firm and they do not feel the need of running away, of diverting\
    \ themselves by the unchecked speed of the unrestrained gallop, etc. [43]Galloping\
    \ men do not reason these things out, but they know them instinctively. They understand\
    \ that they have before them a moral impulse superior to theirs. They become uneasy,\
    \ hesitate. Their hands instinctively turn their horses aside. There is no longer\
    \ freedom in the attack at a gallop. Some go on to the end, but three-fourths\
    \ have already tried to avoid the shock. There is complete disorder, demoralization,\
    \ flight. Then begins the pursuit at a gallop by the men who attacked at the trot.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases
    like "happy", "good", "love", etc. However, it does contain words like "lost",
    "surprised", "uneasy", "hesitate", "demoralization", "flight", which have negative
    connotations.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text describes a situation where cavalry troops are
    surprised and demoralized by the steady gait of their opponents, leading to disorder
    and flight. This context reinforces the negative sentiment.

    4. Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions like unease, hesitation, and
    demoralization, which are negative emotions.

    5. Intensity Analysis: The text describes a strong and intense situation, with
    words like "complete disorder", "demoralization", and "flight", which suggest
    a strong negative sentiment.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is negative, as the text describes
    a situation where troops are demoralized and flee in disarray.


    Edge Cases: The text does not contain any obvious edge cases, such as sarcasm
    or irony, that would affect the classification.'
