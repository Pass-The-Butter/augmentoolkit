- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\u201CThe same\
    \ activity, the same determination to maneuver, must  prevail everywhere. Every\
    \ mistake and every weakness of the enemy  must be quickly perceived and promptly\
    \ utilized. The troops in the  counter-attack should move forward without hesitation\
    \ and regardless  of the cost. When such a forward movement has to be discontinued,\
    \ the  commander must decide where it shall cease. The efforts of all should \
    \ be directed toward one object, that of tiring and demoralizing the  enemy by\
    \ constant counter-attacks, until the moment arrives when the  commander must\
    \ order the offensive to be assumed.\u201DTHE BRITISH DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1905.[492][492]\

    \ regulations do not mention the rencontre. A normal offensive  battle consists\
    \ of \u201Can advance from point to point. Every lodgment  made in a new firing\
    \ position weakens the enemy\u2019s strength in his  main position, and paves\
    \ the way for a further advance; every advance  must be thoroughly prepared and\
    \ systematically carried out.\u201D\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or
    phrases, so no sentiment scores are assigned.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no context to analyze.

    4. Emotion Detection: There are no emotions expressed in the text, so no sentiment
    scores are assigned.

    5. Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no intensity to analyze.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, since there are no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a passage about military tactics and regulations, and it
    does not express any emotions or opinions. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
