    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"When the enemy\u2019\
    s army is covered by a river, upon which he holds several _t\xEAtes de pont_,\
    \ do not attack in front. This would divide your force and expose you to be turned.\
    \ Approach the river in echelon of columns, in such a manner that the leading\
    \ column shall be the only one the enemy can attack, without offering you his\
    \ flank. In the meantime, let your light troops occupy the bank, and when you\
    \ have decided on the point of passage, rush upon it and fling across your bridge.\
    \ Observe that the point of passage should be always at a distance from the leading\
    \ echelon, in order to deceive the enemy.NOTE.If you occupy a town or a village\
    \ on the bank of a river, opposite to that held by the enemy, it is an advantage\
    \ to make this spot the crossing point, because it is easier to cover your carriages\
    \ and reserve artillery, as well as to mask the construction of your bridge, in\
    \ a town, than in the open country. It is also a great advantage to pass a river\
    \ opposite a village, when the latter is only weakly occupied by the enemy; because\
    \ as soon as the advanced guard reaches the other side, it carries this post,\
    \ makes a lodgment, and by throwing up a few defensive works, converts it easily\
    \ into a _t\xEAte de pont_. By this means, the rest of the army is enabled to\
    \ effect the passage with facility.MAXIM XXXVII.\"\"\""

- content: 'I would classify the input text as "neutral". Here''s my reasoning:


    1. The text is a passage from a military strategy book, and it does not contain
    any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that would indicate a positive or negative
    sentiment.

    2. The text is written in a formal and objective tone, providing instructions
    and advice on how to cross a river during a military campaign. There is no emotional
    language or personal opinions expressed.

    3. The text does not contain any words or phrases that would indicate a strong
    sentiment, such as "love", "hate", "amazing", etc.

    4. The text is primarily focused on providing tactical advice and strategies,
    rather than expressing a personal opinion or emotion.


    Overall, the text appears to be a neutral and informative passage, providing guidance
    on military strategy without expressing any sentiment or emotion.'
