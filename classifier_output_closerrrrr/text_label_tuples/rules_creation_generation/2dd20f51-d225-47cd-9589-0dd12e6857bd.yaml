- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The system of column\
    \ tactics, which required that every company should be equally skilled in extended\
    \ order fighting, led to the abolishment of _\xE9lite_ companies. The Prussian\
    \ _\xE9lite_, consisting of the platoons formed from the third rank, although\
    \ not always compatible with the employment of company columns, was not abolished\
    \ until 1876. The experience of the Franco-German war had shown that, in view\
    \ of the extensive use of extended order formations, an independent employment\
    \ of single platoons was out of the question, as in the course of an action the\
    \ firing line absorbs not only entire companies, but regiments and brigades; and,\
    \ moreover, that every platoon, as a unit for fire action, must possess those\
    \ elements which will carry it forward even after its leader has fallen.Napoleon\
    \ formed his Guards by selecting men and officers from the entire army for use\
    \ as a battle reserve. By granting them privileges and by loading them with distinctions,\
    \ he attached them to his person, and they assumed the character of household\
    \ troops of a dynasty.The Prussian and Russian Guards are differently constituted.\
    \ They are not, strictly speaking, _corps d\u2019\xE9lite_, for they are not selected\
    \ from the ranks of the army. While it is true that the Prussian Guard receives\
    \ a better class of recruits and the composition of its corps of officers and\
    \ the selection of its commanders guarantee conspicuous results, its principal\
    \ superiority lies in the fact that it serves constantly under the eye of the\
    \ emperor.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words or phrases.
    However, it does contain words related to military tactics and history, which
    do not carry sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no need to adjust the sentiment score.

    4. Emotion Detection: The text does not express emotions such as joy, sadness,
    fear, or anger.

    5. Intensity Analysis: Since there are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    there is no need to analyze intensity.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there are no
    sentiment-bearing words or phrases in the text.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain mixed sentiment, sarcasm, or irony, so
    it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a historical or educational passage about military tactics
    and the composition of guards, without expressing any sentiment or emotion.'
