    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"Such cannot be\
    \ the fate of a commander who, knowing all the value of acting on the offensive,\
    \ shakes, by the vigor and address of his first movements, the moral as well as\
    \ physical force of his enemy,--who, selecting his own time, and place, and mode\
    \ of attack, confounds his antagonist by enterprises equally hardy and unexpected,--and\
    \ who at last leaves to him only the alternative of resistance without hope, or\
    \ of flying without resistance.\"The British army, in the war of the American\
    \ Revolution, must have been most wretchedly ignorant of these leading maxims\
    \ for conducting offensive war. Instead of concentrating their forces on some\
    \ decisive point, and then destroying the main body of our army by repeated and\
    \ well-directed blows, they scattered their forces over an immense extent of country,\
    \ and became too weak to act with decision and effect on any one point. On the\
    \ other hand, this policy enabled us to call out and discipline our scattered\
    \ and ill-provided forces.The main object in _defensive_ war is, to protect the\
    \ menaced territory, to retard the enemy's progress, to multiply obstacles in\
    \ his way, to guard the vital points of the country, and--at the favorable moment,\
    \ when the enemy becomes enfeebled by detachments, losses, privations, and fatigue--to\
    \ assume the offensive, and drive him from the country. This combination of the\
    \ defensive and offensive has many advantages. The enemy, being forced to take\
    \ the defensive in his turn, loses much of the moral superiority due to successful\
    \ offensive operations. There are numerous instances of this kind of war, \"the\
    \ defensive-offensive,\" as it is sometimes called, to be found in history. The\
    \ last four campaigns of Frederick the Great of Prussia, are examples which may\
    \ serve as models. Wellington played a similar part in the Spanish peninsula.\"\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"neutral\".\n\n\
    Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words\
    \ or tokens. Punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words and phrases,\
    \ such as \"vigor\", \"address\", \"hardy\", \"unexpected\", \"wretchedly\", \"\
    ignorant\", \"decisive\", \"effect\", \"multiply\", \"obstacles\", \"vital\",\
    \ \"enfeebled\", \"fatigue\", \"moral\", and \"superiority\". These words and\
    \ phrases are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g. \"vigor\", \"\
    hardy\", \"unexpected\", \"decisive\", \"effect\")\n\t* Negative: -1 (e.g. \"\
    wretchedly\", \"ignorant\", \"enfeebled\", \"fatigue\")\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g.\
    \ \"address\", \"multiply\", \"obstacles\", \"vital\", \"moral\", \"superiority\"\
    )\n3. Contextual Analysis: The text's context is analyzed, and the sentiment scores\
    \ are adjusted accordingly. For example, the phrase \"wretchedly ignorant\" is\
    \ preceded by \"must have been\", which is a neutral phrase, so the sentiment\
    \ score remains -1.\n4. Emotion Detection: The text expresses emotions such as\
    \ frustration, disappointment, and determination, but these emotions are not strong\
    \ enough to dominate the overall sentiment.\n5. Intensity Analysis: The intensity\
    \ of the sentiment-bearing words and phrases is analyzed. The text contains both\
    \ strong and weak sentiment-bearing words and phrases, which cancel each other\
    \ out.\n6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing\
    \ up the sentiment scores of all tokens. The score is close to 0, indicating a\
    \ neutral sentiment.\n\nGiven the neutral overall sentiment score, I classify\
    \ the input text as \"neutral\"."
