- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here's a set of rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"But however much\
    \ we feel a desire to see the actors in War outdo each other in hidden activity,\
    \ readiness, and stratagem, still we must admit that these qualities show themselves\
    \ but little in history, and have rarely been able to work their way to the surface\
    \ from amongst the mass of relations and circumstances.The explanation of this\
    \ is obvious, and it is almost identical with the subject matter of the preceding\
    \ chapter.Strategy knows no other activity than the regulating of combat with\
    \ the measures which relate to it. It has no concern, like ordinary life, with\
    \ transactions which consist merely of words--that is, in expressions, declarations,\
    \ &c. But these, which are very inexpensive, are chiefly the means with which\
    \ the wily one takes in those he practises upon.That which there is like it in\
    \ War, plans and orders given merely as make-believers, false reports sent on\
    \ purpose to the enemy--is usually of so little effect in the strategic field\
    \ that it is only resorted to in particular cases which offer of themselves, therefore\
    \ cannot be regarded as spontaneous action which emanates from the leader.But\
    \ such measures as carrying out the arrangements for a battle, so far as to impose\
    \ upon the enemy, require a considerable expenditure of time and power; of course,\
    \ the greater the impression to be made, the greater the expenditure in these\
    \ respects. And as this is usually not given for the purpose, very few demonstrations,\
    \ so-called, in Strategy, effect the object for which they are designed. In fact,\
    \ it is dangerous to detach large forces for any length of time merely for a trick,\
    \ because there is always the risk of its being done in vain, and then these forces\
    \ are wanted at the decisive point.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    **Tokenization**


    * Split the text into individual words or tokens.

    * Removed punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words.


    **Sentiment Analysis**


    * Found no sentiment-bearing words or phrases in the text.

    * Assigned a sentiment score of 0 for each token.


    **Contextual Analysis**


    * No sentiment-bearing words or phrases were found in the text, so no adjustments
    were made to the sentiment scores.


    **Emotion Detection**


    * No emotions were detected in the text.


    **Intensity Analysis**


    * No intensity was detected in the text.


    **Overall Sentiment**


    * Calculated the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of
    all tokens: 0.

    * Classified the text as "neutral" since the overall sentiment score is close
    to 0.


    **Edge Cases**


    * The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases, so it is classified
    as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a passage of historical or strategic analysis, discussing
    the nature of war and strategy. It does not contain any emotional language or
    sentiment-bearing words, so it is classified as "neutral".'
