    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", etc.\
    \ that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n* For each\
    \ token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"good\", \"\
    love\", etc.) or a sentiment-bearing phrase (e.g. \"I love\", \"I hate\", etc.).\n\
    * If a token has a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, assign it a sentiment score\
    \ (e.g. +1 for positive, -1 for negative).\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\
    \n* For each token, check its context by looking at the surrounding tokens.\n\
    * If a token is preceded or followed by a sentiment-bearing word or phrase, adjust\
    \ its sentiment score accordingly.\n* For example, if a token \"bad\" is preceded\
    \ by \"I love\", adjust its sentiment score to +1 (positive).\n\n**Rule 4: Emotion\
    \ Detection**\n\n* Identify emotions expressed in the text, such as joy, sadness,\
    \ anger, etc.\n* Assign a sentiment score based on the emotion detected:\n\t+\
    \ Joy, love, excitement: +1 (positive)\n\t+ Sadness, fear, anger: -1 (negative)\n\
    \n**Rule 5: Intensity Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its intensity by looking\
    \ at the strength of the sentiment-bearing word or phrase.\n* Assign a sentiment\
    \ score based on the intensity:\n\t+ Mild sentiment (e.g. \"good\"): +0.5 (neutral)\n\
    \t+ Strong sentiment (e.g. \"amazing\"): +1.5 (positive)\n\t+ Very strong sentiment\
    \ (e.g. \"love\"): +2.5 (very positive)\n\n**Rule 6: Overall Sentiment**\n\n*\
    \ Calculate the overall sentiment score by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ all tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is positive, classify the text\
    \ as \"positive\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is negative, classify the\
    \ text as \"negative\".\n* If the overall sentiment score is neutral (i.e. close\
    \ to 0), classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 7: Edge Cases**\n\n* Handle\
    \ edge cases such as:\n\t+ Text with no sentiment-bearing words or phrases: classify\
    \ as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with mixed sentiment (e.g. both positive and negative):\
    \ classify as \"neutral\"\n\t+ Text with sarcasm or irony: classify as \"negative\"\
    \ (or \"positive\" if the sarcasm is being used to express a positive sentiment)\n\
    \nBy following these rules, an AI can classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\"\
    , or \"neutral\" with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that\
    \ sentiment analysis is a complex task and may require fine-tuning and adaptation\
    \ to specific domains or languages.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"REGULATIONS and\
    \ METHODS bring preparatory theories into the conduct of War, in so far as disciplined\
    \ troops are inoculated with them as active principles. The whole body of instructions\
    \ for formations, drill, and field service are regulations and methods: in the\
    \ drill instructions the first predominate, in the field service instructions\
    \ the latter. To these things the real conduct of War attaches itself; it takes\
    \ them over, therefore, as given modes of proceeding, and as such they must appear\
    \ in the theory of the conduct of War.But for those activities retaining freedom\
    \ in the employment of these forces there cannot be regulations, that is, definite\
    \ instructions, because they would do away with freedom of action. Methods, on\
    \ the other hand, as a general way of executing duties as they arise, calculated,\
    \ as we have said, on an average of probability, or as a dominating influence\
    \ of principles and rules carried through to application, may certainly appear\
    \ in the theory of the conduct of War, provided only they are not represented\
    \ as something different from what they are, not as the absolute and necessary\
    \ modes of action (systems), but as the best of general forms which may be used\
    \ as shorter ways in place of a particular disposition for the occasion, at discretion.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the
    text.

    3. Contextual Analysis: No sentiment-bearing words or phrases are found in the
    text, so no adjustments are made to the sentiment scores.

    4. Emotion Detection: No emotions are expressed in the text.

    5. Intensity Analysis: No intensity is detected in the text.

    6. Overall Sentiment: The overall sentiment score is 0, as no sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases are found in the text.

    7. Edge Cases: The text does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases,
    so it is classified as "neutral".


    The text appears to be a philosophical or theoretical discussion about war and
    military strategy, and does not contain any emotional language or sentiment-bearing
    words or phrases. Therefore, it is classified as "neutral".'
