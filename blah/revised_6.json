    "How does the text define \"simple sabotage\" and distinguish it from other forms of sabotage?",
    "The text defines \"simple sabotage\" as a type of sabotage that does not require specially prepared tools or equipment, and can be executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group. It is differentiated from other forms of sabotage by its comparative ease of execution and the lack of danger and risk involved.",
    "The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3.

INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.",
