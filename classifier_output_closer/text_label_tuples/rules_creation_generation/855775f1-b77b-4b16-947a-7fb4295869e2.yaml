- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In\
    \ point of fact, the ultimate object of our Wars, the political one, is not always\
    \ quite a simple one; and even were it so, still the action is bound up with such\
    \ a number of conditions and considerations to be taken into account, that the\
    \ object can no longer be attained by one single great act but only through a\
    \ number of greater or smaller acts which are bound up into a whole; each of these\
    \ separate acts is therefore a part of a whole, and has consequently a special\
    \ object by which it is bound to this whole.We have already said that every strategic\
    \ act can be referred to the idea of a combat, because it is an employment of\
    \ the military force, and at the root of that there always lies the idea of fighting.\
    \ We may therefore reduce every military activity in the province of Strategy\
    \ to the unit of single combats, and occupy ourselves with the object of these\
    \ only; we shall get acquainted with these special objects by degrees as we come\
    \ to speak of the causes which produce them; here we content ourselves with saying\
    \ that every combat, great or small, has its own peculiar object in subordination\
    \ to the main object. If this is the case then, the destruction and conquest of\
    \ the enemy is only to be regarded as the means of gaining this object; as it\
    \ unquestionably is.But this result is true only in its form, and important only\
    \ on account of the connection which the ideas have between themselves, and we\
    \ have only sought it out to get rid of it at once.What is overcoming the enemy?\
    \ Invariably the destruction of his military force, whether it be by death, or\
    \ wounds, or any means; whether it be completely or only to such a degree that\
    \ he can no longer continue the contest; therefore as long as we set aside all\
    \ special objects of combats, we may look upon the complete or partial destruction\
    \ of the enemy as the only object of all combats.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "fact", "simple", "great", "special", which are neutral.
    Others have words like "ultimate", "bound", "whole", which are neutral as well.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked. The text is about
    military strategy and combat, which is a neutral topic. The language used is formal
    and objective, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have neutral sentiment
    scores, the overall score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s context is formal and objective,
    without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it lacks sentiment-bearing
    words, emoticons, and special characters that convey sentiment. The language used
    is formal and objective, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
