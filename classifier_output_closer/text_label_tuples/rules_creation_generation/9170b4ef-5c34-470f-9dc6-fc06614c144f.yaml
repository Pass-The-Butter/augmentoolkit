- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"[405]\
    \ At Villepion, Captain von Hoffmann made a wavering section  hold its position\
    \ by springing toward them, revolver in hand, and  yelling: \u201CI\u2019ll shoot\
    \ the first man who gets up! my revolver will  hit too, whether Chassepot bullets\
    \ will hit you is a question.\u201D  _Geschichte des Bayerischen Leibregiments_.If\
    \ the assault is not made at this moment, the crisis may pass, but a determined\
    \ rush by the attacker will, as a rule, bring about the decision. The threat of\
    \ a bayonet attack usually decides those who have remained in the position, to\
    \ make no further resistance. The attacker must make use of the moral factors\
    \ in an assault, hence the importance of running, cheering, and accompanying the\
    \ advance of all bodies in close order by the beating of drums and the sounding\
    \ of trumpets.[406][406] One must read KUNZ, _Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele_,\
    \ 13, pp.  80, 116, 123 and 156, in order to appreciate what an electrifying \
    \ influence the beating of drums may have even on retreating lines.\u201CThe French\
    \ were unable to withstand an energetic attack, when  undertaken in anything like\
    \ sufficient strength and accompanied by  cheers and beating drums.\u201D BOGUSLAWSKI.\u201C\
    Suddenly some soldier shouted: \u2018Columns! Columns!\u2019 Captain von  Wobeser\
    \ rose to see what was going on, but at the same moment his men  rushed back and\
    \ made straight for the Bois.\u201D--\u201CThe mere launching of  the attack from\
    \ the direction of =Point du Jour= sufficed to induce  the well concealed force\
    \ of about 400 men, which held the gravel  pits, likewise to beat a retreat that\
    \ very much resembled a rout.\u201D  H\xD6NIG.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so they
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0). However, some tokens like "wavering",
    "yelling", "will hit", "decides", "cheering", "beating", and "electrifying" have
    positive sentiment scores (+1).

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is mostly neutral, with some phrases
    expressing a sense of urgency or energy (e.g., "determined rush", "cheering",
    "beating drums"). However, there are no explicit positive or negative sentiments.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have neutral sentiment
    scores, the overall score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain contextual dependencies
    that would affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it lacks explicit positive
    or negative sentiments and is primarily focused on describing military tactics
    and strategies.'
