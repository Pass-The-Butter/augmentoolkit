- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"When\
    \ there are practicable roads in the neighborhood, suitable at least for infantry\
    \ and cavalry, the intervals may be diminished. It is scarcely necessary to add\
    \ that such an order of march can only be used when provisions are plentiful;\
    \ and the third method is usually the best, because the army is then marching\
    \ in battle-order. In long days and in hot countries the best times for marching\
    \ are the night and the early part of the day. It is one of the most difficult\
    \ problems of logistics to make suitable arrangements of hours of departures and\
    \ halts for armies; and this is particularly the case in retreats.Many generals\
    \ neglect to arrange the manner and times of halts, and great disorder on the\
    \ march is the consequence, as each brigade or division takes the responsibility\
    \ of halting whenever the soldiers are a little tired and find it agreeable to\
    \ bivouac. The larger the army and the more compactly it marches, the more important\
    \ does it become to arrange well the hours of departures and halts, especially\
    \ if the army is to move at night. An ill-timed halt of part of a column may cause\
    \ as much mischief as a rout.If the rear-guard is closely pressed, the army should\
    \ halt in order to relieve it by a fresh corps taken from the second mass, which\
    \ will halt with this object in view. The enemy seeing eighty thousand men in\
    \ battle-order will think it necessary to halt and collect his columns; and then\
    \ the retreat should recommence at nightfall, to regain the space which has been\
    \ lost.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. The
    text does not contain any explicit sentiment-bearing words, so the sentiment score
    for each token is 0 (neutral).

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. The text discusses
    military strategies and logistics, which are neutral topics. There are no phrases
    or sentences that express a positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since all tokens have
    a neutral sentiment score, the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous tokens in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: There are no negated tokens in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: There are no intensified tokens in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: There are no emoticons or special
    characters in the text that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: There are no out-of-vocabulary words in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain any contextual
    dependencies that would affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it discusses neutral topics
    and does not contain any sentiment-bearing words, negations, intensifiers, or
    emoticons that would indicate a positive or negative sentiment.'
