    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Attacking\

    \           1 officer for every 14 menFor the purpose of comparison, we should\
    \ like to mention that the  Prussian Grenadier Battalion \u201C_von Wedel_,\u201D\
    \ consisting of 12 officers  and 390 men, lost 10 officers and 301 men (77%) in\
    \ about one hour  during the battle of =Soor= (Sept. 30th, 1745). The losses suffered\

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so they
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0). However, some tokens have sentiment-bearing
    words like "strikingly" (positive), "shot down" (negative), "lost" (negative),
    and "considerably more" (neutral).

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of the text is mostly neutral, discussing
    military battles and statistics. However, some phrases like "strikingly how rapidly
    the officers directing the fire were shot down" and "considerably more than 50%
    of their strength" have a slightly negative tone.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly neutral, with
    a slight leaning towards negative due to the negative sentiment-bearing words.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment depends on the context
    of surrounding tokens, but this is handled by the contextual analysis rule.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it discusses military battles
    and statistics in a factual and objective manner, without expressing a clear positive
    or negative sentiment.'
