    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"IV.\
    \ _Connection_.--Every commander must have and must maintain a fixed place in\
    \ the column, and an orderly officer must be detached from each unit to headquarters,\
    \ so that instructions may be conveyed to such commanders at all times. Units\
    \ must be closed up, and the usual distances lessened or dispensed with, and connection\
    \ must be maintained between units and their sub-divisions. The pace should be\
    \ uniform, but not more than 2 miles an hour can be expected on a dark night,\
    \ including halts. The time and periods of halts should be arranged before starting,\
    \ and units must regain any distance lost before halting. After crossing or clearing\
    \ an obstacle the column should advance its own length and then be halted until\
    \ reported to be closed up again, and staff officers should be detailed to superintend\
    \ these matters. In addition to these general principles there are certain axioms,\
    \ which must become \"rules of thumb\" with all concerned:--An officer must march\
    \ in rear of each unit.All ranks must be informed what to do in case of alarm\
    \ or attack.Fire will not be opened without orders.Magazines will be charged,\
    \ but no cartridge placed in the chamber.There must be absolute silence, no smoking,\
    \ no lights.{147}When halted, men may lie down in their places, but must not quit\
    \ the ranks.NIGHT ADVANCES.--Night advances are the movement of deployed troops\
    \ to gain ground towards the hostile position with a view to delivering an assault\
    \ at dawn. They may take place as a preliminary to an engagement, or to continue\
    \ one already begun with increased prospects of success. In the first case they\
    \ are usually the sequel to a Night March, and in either case they are generally\
    \ followed by an attack at dawn. Surprise is the main object, even when they are\
    \ undertaken for the purpose of gaining ground difficult to cross in daylight,\
    \ from which to renew an engagement, as frequently happens d\"\"\""
  role: user
- content: I would classify the input text as "neutral". The text appears to be a
    military document discussing tactics and strategies for marching and advancing
    troops at night. It does not contain any sentiment-bearing words or phrases that
    would suggest a positive or negative sentiment. The language used is formal and
    objective, and the text does not express any emotions or opinions.
