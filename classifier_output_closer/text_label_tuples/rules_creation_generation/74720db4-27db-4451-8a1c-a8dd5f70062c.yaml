- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"When\
    \ the enemy, for instance, is in force in the vicinity, and his actions, such\
    \ as throwing up of entrenchments, harassing camp in large numbers, imply that\
    \ he will offer vigorous resistance to the advance, it is probable that the baggage\
    \ and supply column will be best parked, under sufficient guard, either in the\
    \ camp, or in some other locality easy of defence, whilst the remainder move off,\
    \ in preparatory formation for action.If the clansmen are reported to be inclined\
    \ to dispute the advance in force, but are some distance from the camp, the most\
    \ suitable order of march may be deduced as follows.The enemy being in strength,\
    \ the column should move in compact formation, and deliberately, the advanced\
    \ guard being pushed only so far forward as to secure the troops from surprise,\
    \ and as few road picquets sent out as may be, in order that the fighting force\
    \ may be reduced as little as possible.The method of posting and withdrawing picquets\
    \ will not materially differ from that which will be described later.The tribesmen\
    \ being known to be in force and prepared to resist, it follows that the bulk\
    \ of the fighting men must be at the head of the column; and as the advanced guard\
    \ will be near the remainder, it need be only sufficiently numerous to insure\
    \ that the duties of protection are adequately performed.Suppose the tribesmen\
    \ five miles distant, and that, as a rough basis for calculation, two companies\
    \ can secure about one-and-a-half to two miles of roadway; then about three companies\
    \ will be required for picquetting.If three companies be added for other purposes,\
    \ the advanced guard infantry should be of sufficient strength.The advanced guard\
    \ will require a proportion of technical troops for road making and repair, and\
    \ for this purpose two companies of pioneers, or the bulk of a company of sappers\
    \ and miners may be allotted.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains no sentiment-bearing words (e.g., "happy",
    "good", "bad", etc.).

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text discusses military tactics and strategies, which
    do not convey a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: Since the text does not contain sentiment-bearing words
    and does not convey a clear sentiment, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is present in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negation is present in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers are present in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    are present in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are present in
    the text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are present in
    the text.


    The text appears to be a neutral, informative passage discussing military tactics
    and strategies, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
