- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Surely,\
    \ the affair is ridiculous and laughable.Let us see, however. In a thick forest,\
    \ a lion and a tiger meet face to face at a turn in the trail. They stop at once,\
    \ rearing and ready to spring. They measure each other with their eyes, there\
    \ is a rumbling in their throats. The claws move convulsively, the hair stands\
    \ up. With tails lashing the ground, and necks stretched, ears flattened, lips\
    \ turned up, they show their formidable fangs in that terrible threatening grimace\
    \ of fear characteristic of felines.Unseen, I shudder.The situation is disagreeable\
    \ for both: movement ahead means the death of a beast. Of which? Of both perhaps.Slowly,\
    \ quite slowly, one leg, bent for the leap, bending still, moves a few inches\
    \ to the rear. Gently, quite gently, a fore paw follows the movement. After a\
    \ stop, slowly, quite slowly, the other legs do the same, and both beasts, insensibly,\
    \ little by little, and always facing, withdraw, up to the moment where their\
    \ mutual withdrawal has created between them an interval greater than can be traversed\
    \ in a bound. Lion and tiger turn their backs slowly and, without ceasing to observe,\
    \ walk freely. They resume without haste their natural gaits, with that sovereign\
    \ dignity characteristic of great seigneurs. I have ceased to shudder, but I do\
    \ not laugh.There is no more to laugh at in man in battle, because he has in his\
    \ hands a weapon more terrible than the fangs and claws of lion or tiger, the\
    \ rifle, which instantly, without possible defense, sends one from life into death.\
    \ It is evident that no one close to his enemy is in a hurry to arm himself, to\
    \ put into action a force which may kill him. He is not anxious to light the fuse\
    \ that is to blow up the enemy, and himself at the same time.Who has not observed\
    \ like instances between dogs, between dog and cat, cat and cat?\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "ridiculous", "laughable", "disagreeable", "fear", "terrible",
    "sovereign", and "dignity", which have a neutral or negative sentiment. Other
    tokens have words like "slowly", "gently", "freely", and "sovereign", which have
    a neutral sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked. For example, the
    phrase "I shudder" has a negative sentiment, but the phrase "I have ceased to
    shudder" has a neutral sentiment. The phrase "I do not laugh" has a negative sentiment,
    but the phrase "There is no more to laugh at" has a neutral sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly neutral, with
    some negative sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are found.


    The overall sentiment of the text is neutral, with some negative sentiment. Therefore,
    I classify the text as "neutral".'
