- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Another\
    \ no less extraordinary example of the importance of good logistics was afforded\
    \ at the battle of Leipsic. In fighting this battle, with a defile in rear of\
    \ the army as at Leipsic, and in the midst of low ground, wooded, and cut up by\
    \ small streams and gardens, it was highly important to have a number of small\
    \ bridges, to prepare the banks for approaching them with ease, and to stake out\
    \ the roads. These precautions would not have prevented the loss of a decisive\
    \ battle; but they would have saved the lives of a considerable number of men,\
    \ as well as the guns and carriages that were abandoned on account of the disorder\
    \ and of there being no roads of escape. The unaccountable blowing up of the bridge\
    \ of Lindenau was also the result of unpardonable carelessness upon the part of\
    \ the staff corps, which indeed existed only in name, owing to the manner of Berthier's\
    \ management of it. We must also agree that Napoleon, who was perfectly conversant\
    \ with the logistical measures of an offensive campaign, had then never seriously\
    \ thought what would be proper precautions in the event of defeat, and when the\
    \ emperor was present himself no one thought of making any arrangement for the\
    \ future unless by his direction.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. None
    of the tokens have explicit sentiment-bearing words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text is analyzed for phrases or sentences that express
    a positive or negative sentiment. The text describes a historical event and provides
    details about the battle, but it does not express a clear positive or negative
    sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since none of the tokens have explicit
    sentiment-bearing words, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is detected in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negation is detected in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers are detected in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are detected in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are detected in
    the text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are detected
    in the text.


    The text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain explicit sentiment-bearing
    words and does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
