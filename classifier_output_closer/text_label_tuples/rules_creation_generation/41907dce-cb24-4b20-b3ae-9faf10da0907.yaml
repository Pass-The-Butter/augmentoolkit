- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Whenever\
    \ an American soldier falls in action or dies of disease, he receives as good\
    \ a burial as the circumstances permit, and his grave is distinctly marked, so\
    \ that there will be no possibility of its not being found when the time for removal\
    \ comes. It may be months before the day arrives, but it is sure to come at last,\
    \ and then the bodies are taken up and put in leaden-lined coffins and transported\
    \ home.[Illustration: Burial at Arlington of 426 American soldiers who fell in\
    \ Cuba.]The year after the Cuban campaign I attended the burial of four hundred\
    \ and twenty-six officers and men at Arlington, the great national cemetery on\
    \ the beautiful, sloping banks of the Potomac River, opposite Washington. The\
    \ President, the members of the cabinet, the commanding general of the army, and\
    \ other high officials of state were there to pay their respect to the noble dead\
    \ as they were laid to rest in the company of the thousands of others who gave\
    \ their lives for their country in the Civil War. The long lines of coffins, each\
    \ one draped with a flag, resting beside the open graves, ready to be lowered,\
    \ told a heavy story of the breakage of war. Two chaplains, one Protestant and\
    \ the other Roman Catholic, read the service for the burial of the dead, while\
    \ a soldier stood at each grave and sprinkled the symbolic handful of earth upon\
    \ the coffin. At the end of the ceremony the artillery boomed the last salute,\
    \ and the trumpeters sounded the slow, mournful notes of \u201Ctaps.\u201D The\
    \ imposing funeral cost the government a great amount of money. But each year\
    \ the soldier dead are gathered home; the dead of every war our country has waged\
    \ have been brought together, a silent army of heroic men. These graves will be\
    \ cared for and the names will be preserved so long as the nation lasts.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "good",
    "noble", and "heroic", which are assigned a sentiment score of +1. However, the
    text also contains words with neutral or negative connotations, such as "breakage
    of war", "heavy story", and "mournful notes", which are assigned a sentiment score
    of 0 or -1.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text is analyzed in context to determine the overall
    sentiment. The text describes a somber and respectful burial ceremony, but it
    does not express a strong emotional tone.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is neutral, as the positive
    and negative sentiments cancel each other out.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are identified.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are identified.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are identified.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    are identified that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are identified.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment is analyzed in context,
    and the overall sentiment is determined to be neutral.


    The text is a descriptive passage about a burial ceremony, and while it contains
    some sentiment-bearing words, the overall tone is neutral.'
