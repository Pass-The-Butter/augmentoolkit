- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"These\
    \ Prussian fortresses were retained by Napoleon at the treaty of Tilsit. The campaign\
    \ of 1809 proved the wisdom of this policy, as they effectually prevented Prussia\
    \ from joining Austria in rekindling the flames of war. And again in 1813, these\
    \ works might have produced a decided influence on the campaign, had not the political\
    \ perfidy of Austria, and the treason of the French generals, prevented Napoleon\
    \ from profiting by the advantages of his position.The influence of the fortifications\
    \ of Spain upon the Peninsular campaigns has often been alluded to by historians.\
    \ Those works which had been given up to Napoleon previous to the opening of hostilities,\
    \ contributed very much to the success of his arms; while those which had been\
    \ retained by Spain and her allies contributed in an equal degree to fetter and\
    \ embarrass his operations. Some of these, like Saragossa, Tarragona, Gerona,\
    \ Tortosa, &c. &c., with their broken walls and defective armaments, kept the\
    \ enemy in check for months; and, by compelling the French to resort to the tedious\
    \ operations of sieges, did much to weaken the French power in the Peninsula.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", "a", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text is analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include "wisdom", "prevented",
    "influence", "success", "embarrass", "check", "weaken".

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "prevented" is part of a phrase that expresses a negative
    sentiment, so it is assigned a negative sentiment score. Similarly, "influence"
    is part of a phrase that expresses a positive sentiment, so it is assigned a positive
    sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated
    by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The sentiment score is
    mostly neutral, with some positive and negative sentiment-bearing words.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Some tokens, like "influence", have multiple possible sentiment
    interpretations. In this case, the context of the token helps to disambiguate
    the sentiment.

    6. Handling Negation: There are no negated tokens in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: There are no intensified tokens in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: There are no emoticons or special
    characters in the text that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: There are no out-of-vocabulary words in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain any contextual
    dependencies that affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it contains both positive
    and negative sentiment-bearing words, but the overall sentiment is balanced and
    does not lean strongly towards either positive or negative.'
