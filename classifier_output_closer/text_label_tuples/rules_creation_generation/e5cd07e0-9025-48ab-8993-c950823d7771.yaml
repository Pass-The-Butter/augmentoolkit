- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Clausewitz\
    \ says, \"It is a fact that we may search modern military history in vain for\
    \ a battle (except Leuthen or Rosbach) in which an army has beaten another double\
    \ its own strength, an occurrence by no means uncommon in former times. Bonaparte,\
    \ the greatest general of modern days, in all his great victorious battles, with\
    \ one exception, that of Dresden 1813, had managed to assemble an army superior\
    \ in numbers, or at least very little inferior, to that of his opponent, and when\
    \ it was impossible for him to do so, as at Leipzig, Brienne, Laon, Waterloo,\
    \ he was beaten.\"[43] \"From this we may infer, in the present state of Europe,\
    \ that it is very difficult for the most talented general to gain a victory over\
    \ an enemy double his strength. Now, if we see that double numbers are such a\
    \ weight in the scale against even the greatest generals, we may be sure that\
    \ in ordinary cases, in small as well as in great combats, an important superiority\
    \ of numbers, but which need not be over _two to one_, will be sufficient to _ensure\
    \ the victory_, however disadvantageous other circumstances may be.\"[44]The double\
    \ superiority of numbers at the decisive point is, therefore, the ideal of strategy.\
    \ \"_The superiority of numbers is, therefore, to be regarded as the fundamental\
    \ idea, always to be aimed at, before all_, and as far as possible.\" If strategy\
    \ has done this, then it has done its utmost duty. It is then for the tactician\
    \ to make the most of this superiority thus provided by strategy, and win the\
    \ victory. Strategy then repeats the operation with new combinations suited to\
    \ the altered circumstances to win the next battle, and so on, till the hostile\
    \ armed force is destroyed.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing\
    \ words. Some examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include \"fact\"\
    , \"great\", \"victorious\", \"difficult\", \"important\", \"ensure\", \"fundamental\"\
    , and \"utmost\". These words are assigned sentiment scores as follows:\n\t* Positive:\
    \ +1 (e.g. \"great\", \"victorious\")\n\t* Negative: -1 (none)\n\t* Neutral: 0\
    \ (e.g. \"fact\", \"difficult\")\n3. Contextual Analysis: The tokens are analyzed\
    \ in context to determine their sentiment. For example, the phrase \"the greatest\
    \ general of modern days\" is positive, while the phrase \"it is very difficult\
    \ for the most talented general to gain a victory\" is neutral.\n4. Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation: The overall sentiment score for the text is calculated by summing\
    \ up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The text has a mix of positive\
    \ and neutral sentiment, but no strong negative sentiment.\n5. Handling Ambiguity:\
    \ There are no ambiguous tokens in the text.\n6. Handling Negation: There are\
    \ no negated tokens in the text.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: There are no intensified\
    \ tokens in the text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: There are\
    \ no emoticons or special characters in the text that convey sentiment.\n9. Handling\
    \ Out-of-Vocabulary Words: There are no out-of-vocabulary words in the text.\n\
    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain any contextual\
    \ dependencies that affect the sentiment analysis.\n\nOverall, the text is classified\
    \ as \"neutral\" because it discusses military strategy and tactics in a neutral\
    \ and objective manner, without expressing a strong positive or negative sentiment."
