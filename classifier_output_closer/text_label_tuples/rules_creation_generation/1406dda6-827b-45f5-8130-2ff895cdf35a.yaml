- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The\
    \ figures may be perfect squares, or elongated to give a large front and pour\
    \ a heavier column of fire in the direction of the enemy. A regiment of three\
    \ battalions will thus form a long square, by wheeling the center battalion half\
    \ to the right and half to the left.In the Turkish wars squares were almost exclusively\
    \ used, because hostilities were carried on in the vast plains of Bessarabia,\
    \ Moldavia, or Wallachia, and the Turks had an immense force of cavalry. But if\
    \ the seat of war be the Balkan Mountains or beyond them, and their irregular\
    \ cavalry be replaced by an army organized according to the proportions usual\
    \ in Europe, the importance of the square will disappear, and the Russian infantry\
    \ will show its superiority in Rumelia.However this may be, the order in squares\
    \ by regiments or battalions seems suitable for every kind of attack, when the\
    \ assailant has not the superiority in cavalry and maneuvers on level ground advantageous\
    \ for the enemy's charges. The elongated square, especially when applied to a\
    \ battalion of eight companies, three of which would march in front and one on\
    \ each side, would be much better to make an attack than a deployed battalion.\
    \ It would not be so good as the column proposed above; but there would be less\
    \ unsteadiness and more impulsion than if the battalion marched in a deployed\
    \ line. It would have the advantage, also, of being prepared to resist cavalry.Squares\
    \ may also be drawn up in echelons, so as entirely to unmask each other. All the\
    \ orders of battle may be formed of squares as well as with deployed lines.\"\"\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the text as \"neutral\".\n\nHere's\
    \ the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or\
    \ tokens. Stop words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\", etc. are removed.\n2. Sentiment\
    \ Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words like \"perfect\", \"large\", \"\
    heavier\", \"superior\", etc. are identified. Sentiment scores are assigned as\
    \ follows:\n\t* Positive: +1\n\t* Negative: -1\n\t* Neutral: 0\n3. Contextual\
    \ Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its sentiment score.\
    \ Most tokens have neutral or unclear sentiment, so they are assigned a neutral\
    \ score.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated\
    \ by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have\
    \ neutral scores, the overall sentiment score is also neutral.\n5. Handling Ambiguity:\
    \ Tokens with multiple possible sentiment interpretations are analyzed in context.\
    \ Since most tokens are neutral or unclear, ambiguity is not a significant issue.\n\
    6. Handling Negation: Negation is not a significant issue in this text, as there\
    \ are no negated tokens.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: Intensifiers like \"very\"\
    \ or \"extremely\" are not present in this text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters: Emoticons and special characters are not present in this text.\n\
    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: The text does not contain any out-of-vocabulary\
    \ words.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: Contextual dependencies are not\
    \ a significant issue in this text, as most tokens have neutral or unclear sentiment.\n\
    \nOverall, the text is classified as \"neutral\" because it primarily discusses\
    \ military tactics and strategies without expressing a clear positive or negative\
    \ sentiment."
