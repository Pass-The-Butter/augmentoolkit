- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"plish\
    \ very little, as it would lack the thorough peace training requisite for cohesive\
    \ action as an organization. If the opinion is entertained that cyclist detachments\
    \ could furnish substantial aid to the cavalry[29] in advance of the army, that\
    \ they could be employed profitably in the supply districts and in minor operations,\
    \ and, finally, if the available material in the country is to be utilized, nothing\
    \ remains but to proceed to the creation of cyclist companies in time of peace.\
    \ The material necessary for repairs and for ammunition supply can only be entrusted\
    \ to permanent organizations. The advantages of cyclists are their great mobility,[30]\
    \ their prompt readiness for firing, and, above all else, the noiselessness of\
    \ their movements. Their weakness lies in their dependence upon a complicated\
    \ machine, in the comparatively large road space taken up by them on the march\
    \ (100 cyclists in column of twos take up about 250 to 300 m. road space), and\
    \ in their dependence on the terrain. The last mentioned drawback can be remedied\
    \ apparently only by the adoption of a folding wheel, but, since the cyclist\u2019\
    s equipment cannot be secured on the machine, it is better in difficult country\
    \ to push the wheels or to leave them behind under guard when necessary.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "peace", "thorough", "cohesive", "substantial", "profitably",
    "minor", "available", "permanent", "great", "prompt", "noiselessness", "complicated",
    "large", "difficult", which do not have a clear positive or negative sentiment.
    Others have words like "little", "lack", "weakness", "drawback", which have a
    slightly negative tone.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. The text discusses
    the advantages and disadvantages of cyclist detachments, and the discussion is
    neutral, without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens do not have a
    clear positive or negative sentiment, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No tokens have multiple possible sentiment interpretations.

    6. Handling Negation: No tokens are negated.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No tokens are intensified.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No tokens are not recognized by the sentiment
    analysis model.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not depend on the context
    of surrounding tokens.

    11. Final Classification: The text is classified as "neutral".'
