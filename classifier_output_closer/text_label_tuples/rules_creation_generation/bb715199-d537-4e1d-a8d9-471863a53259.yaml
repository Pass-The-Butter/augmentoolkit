- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Between\
    \ the blockhouses and the second-line system a fortified line is frequently organized\
    \ which is called the \u201Cprotecting line of the artillery.\u201D This is intended\
    \ to repel the advance of the enemy infantry, if they gain possession of the first-line\
    \ system, before they reach the field batteries, or to retard it long enough to\
    \ allow the batteries to fall back. This line is held by the troops of the sector\
    \ which do not belong to the fighting contingent.The distance from the first-line\
    \ system of trenches to the second-line system varies according to the configuration\
    \ of the ground. These second lines should, when possible, overlook the first\
    \ lines, so as to hold them under their fire. The same rules prevail in the location\
    \ of the third lines. In the sectors which seem to particularly interest the enemy,\
    \ very strong \u201Ccheck positions\u201D are prepared in the rear.The troops\
    \ occupying the second and third lines should be protected against bombardment\
    \ as much as possible. It is therefore in these trenches or very near them that\
    \ shelters capable of withstanding heavy gun-fire should be constructed.We say\
    \ \u201Cin or near\u201D advisedly, for it is important to hide the shelters as\
    \ much as possible from the enemy, and, to effect this, it is no inconvenience\
    \ to build them a little in the rear of the trench-lines, if the desired result\
    \ can thus be obtained. Often it will be necessary to do this merely for the purpose\
    \ of getting more favourable ground on which to erect the shelter.The main point\
    \ to emphasize is that these shelters should be connected by means of communication-ways\
    \ permitting quick passage from the shelters to the trench-lines.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "protect", "retard", "hold", "fire", which are neutral.
    Others have words like "enemy", "bombardment", which are negative. However, the
    overall sentiment is neutral.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. The text describes
    military tactics and strategies, which are neutral in sentiment. There are no
    phrases or sentences that express a positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have neutral sentiment,
    the overall score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are found.


    The text is primarily descriptive and lacks emotional language, making it neutral
    in sentiment.'
