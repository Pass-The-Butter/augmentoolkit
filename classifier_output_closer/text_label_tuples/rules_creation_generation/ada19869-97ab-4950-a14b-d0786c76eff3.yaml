- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"\"\
    Now, in the siege of Sebastopol, the trenches of the besiegers  never reached\
    \ the edge of the ditch; so that, had the fortification been  a permanent one,\
    \ the most difficult, slow, and dangerous part of the  siege remained to be undertaken,\
    \ viz., the crowning of the covered  way, the establishment of the breach batteries,\
    \ the descent and passage  of the ditch, and the assault of the breach; in other\
    \ words, at the  moment when the weakness of the temporary works became apparent\
    \ and  fatal, the true strength of the permanent defences would have commenced\
    \  coming into play.\"\"Assuming the progress of the attack to have been as rapid\
    \ as it was  under existing circumstances, the besiegers, on the 8th of September,\
    \  would not yet have been in a condition to crown the covered way, the  siege\
    \ would certainly have extended into the winter; and it may even  be doubted whether\
    \ the place would eventually have fallen, until the  allies were in sufficient\
    \ force to invest the north as well as the  southside.\"General Neil remarks:--\"\
    Struck by the length of the siege of Sebastopol, certain foreign  officers have\
    \ expressed the opinion that masonry-revetted scarps are not  of incontestable\
    \ utility in fortified places.\"\"Sebastopol, a vast retrenched camp, defended\
    \ by field fortifications  of strong profile, derived its principal strength from\
    \ an armament  such as could only exist in an extensive maritime arsenal, and\
    \ from a  large army which always preserved its free communications with the \
    \ interior of Russia.\"\"If the enceinte had been provided with good revetted\
    \ scarps;  if it had been necessary to breach these, and subsequently have been\
    \  compelled to penetrate through difficult passages, in rear of which the  heads\
    \ of our columns would have met an army, Sebastopol would have  been an impregnable\
    \ fortress.\"\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have positive sentiment-bearing words like "rapid", "certainly", and "incontestable",
    while others have negative sentiment-bearing words like "weakness", "fatal", and
    "compelled". However, the overall sentiment of the text is neutral.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked. The text discusses
    the siege of Sebastopol, the strengths and weaknesses of the fortifications, and
    the opinions of foreign officers. The context is informative and neutral, without
    expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since the sentiment scores are mixed
    and the context is neutral, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain contextual dependencies
    that affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it discusses historical events
    and fortifications in a neutral and informative manner, without expressing a clear
    positive or negative sentiment.'
