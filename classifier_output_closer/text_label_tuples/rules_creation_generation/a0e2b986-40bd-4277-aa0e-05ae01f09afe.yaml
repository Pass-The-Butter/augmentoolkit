- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"3d.\
    \ All great d\xE9p\xF4ts should be placed on navigable rivers, canals, railways,\
    \ or practical roads, _communicating with the line of operations_, so that they\
    \ may be transported with ease and rapidity, as the army advances on this line.4th.\
    \ An army should never be without a supply for ten or fifteen days, otherwise\
    \ the best chances of war may be lost, and the army exposed to great inconveniences.\
    \ Templehoff says that the great Frederick, in the campaign of 1757, always carried\
    \ in the Prussian provision-train _bread_ for _six_, and _flour_ for _nine days_,\
    \ and was therefore never at a loss for means to subsist his forces, in undertaking\
    \ any sudden and decisive operation. The Roman soldier usually carried with him\
    \ provisions for fifteen days. Napoleon says, \"Experience has proved that an\
    \ army ought to carry with it a month's provisions, ten days' food being carried\
    \ by the men and baggage-horses and a supply for twenty days by the train of wagons;\
    \ so that at least four hundred and eighty wagons would be required for an army\
    \ of forty thousand men; two hundred and forty being regularly organized, and\
    \ two hundred and forty being obtained by requisition. For this purpose there\
    \ would be a battalion of three companies for the military stores of each division,\
    \ each company having its establishment for forty wagons, twenty being furnished\
    \ by the commissariat, and twenty obtained by requisition. This gives for each\
    \ division one hundred and twenty wagons, and for each army, four hundred and\
    \ eighty. Each battalion for a provision-train should have two hundred and ten\
    \ men.\"\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "great", "good", "inconveniences", "loss", "decisive", "experience",
    "proved", "month", "provisions", "food", "supply", "requisition", "military",
    "stores", "division", "battalion", "provision-train" are sentiment-bearing words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. For example, "great"
    is part of a phrase that expresses a positive sentiment, so it is assigned a positive
    sentiment score. "Inconveniences" is part of a phrase that expresses a negative
    sentiment, so it is assigned a negative sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is neutral because the
    positive and negative sentiment scores balance each other out.


    The text does not contain emoticons or special characters that convey sentiment.
    There are no out-of-vocabulary words. The context of the text is about military
    strategy and logistics, which is a neutral topic.


    Therefore, the classification is "neutral".'
