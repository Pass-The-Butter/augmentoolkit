- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Tanks\
    \ are moving fortresses containing light artillery, machine guns, and rifles,\
    \ and while capable of inflicting heavy losses by fire they can also destroy obstacles,\
    \ weapons, and personnel. Their garrisons are protected against the fire of small\
    \ arms and from shrapnel bullets, but they are very vulnerable to other forms\
    \ of artillery fire. Their mobility and radius of action are governed by the amount\
    \ of petrol carried and by the physical endurance of the crew, but except over\
    \ deep cuttings, {175} broad streams, swamps, very heavily shelled ground, rocky\
    \ and mountainous country, or in thick woods they can move without difficulty.\
    \ \"The power of delivering successful surprise attacks against almost any type\
    \ of defences is one of the most important advantages of the use of Tanks in large\
    \ numbers\" (\"Field Service Regulations,\" vol. ii. (1921)).During the _First\
    \ Battle of the Somme_ (September 1-November 18, 1916) \"Our new heavily armoured\
    \ cars, known as 'Tanks,' now brought into action for the first time, successfully\
    \ co-operated with the infantry, and coming as a surprise to the enemy rank and\
    \ file, gave valuable help in breaking down their resistance. . . . These cars\
    \ proved of great value on various occasions, and the personnel in charge of them\
    \ performed many deeds of remarkable valour\" (Sir D. Haig's Dispatches).AIRCRAFTTwo\
    \ classes of Aircraft are used in the field. Aeroplanes, which are self-propelled\
    \ and have an almost unlimited radius of action; and Kite Balloons, which, in\
    \ favourable weather, can be towed by a lorry and can be moved frequently without\
    \ loss of efficiency.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "heavy", "vulnerable", "surprise", "valuable", and "remarkable",
    which can be interpreted as neutral.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked. Some phrases express
    neutral sentiments, such as "can also destroy obstacles, weapons, and personnel"
    or "can move without difficulty".

    4. Sentiment Score Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have neutral sentiment
    scores, the overall score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are found.


    The text primarily discusses military tactics, vehicles, and equipment, which
    are described in a neutral and factual manner. There is no strong emotional language
    or sentiment that would classify the text as "positive" or "negative".'
