- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"An\
    \ example of this kind is the Inn, which separates Bavaria from Austria: flanked\
    \ on the south by the Tyrolese Alps, on the north by Bohemia and the Danube, its\
    \ narrow front is covered by the three fortified places of Passau, Braunau, and\
    \ Salzburg. Lloyd, with some poetic license, compares this frontier to two impregnable\
    \ bastions whose curtain is formed of three fine forts and whose ditch is one\
    \ of the most rapid of rivers. He has exaggerated these advantages; for his epithet\
    \ of \"impregnable\" was decidedly disproved by the bloody events of 1800, 1805,\
    \ and 1809.The majority of the European states have frontiers by no means so formidable\
    \ as that of the Alps and the Inn, being generally open, or consisting of mountains\
    \ with practicable passes at a considerable number of points. We propose to give\
    \ a set of general maxims equally applicable to all cases.When the topography\
    \ of a frontier is open, there should be no attempt to make a complete line of\
    \ defense by building too many fortresses, requiring armies to garrison them,\
    \ and which, after all, might not prevent an enemy from penetrating the country.\
    \ It is much wiser to build fewer works, and to have them properly located, not\
    \ with the expectation of absolutely preventing the ingress of the enemy, but\
    \ to multiply the impediments to his progress, and, at the same time, to support\
    \ the movements of the army which is to repel him.If it be rare that a fortified\
    \ place of itself absolutely prevents the progress of an army, it is, nevertheless,\
    \ an embarrassment, and compels the army to detach a part of its force or to make\
    \ _d\xE9tours_ in its march; while, on the other hand, it imparts corresponding\
    \ advantages to the army which holds it, covers his depots, flanks, and movements,\
    \ and, finally, is a place of refuge in case of need.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", "a", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words like "bloody", "impregnable",
    "wiser", etc. are identified and assigned sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "bloody" is part of a sentence expressing a negative sentiment,
    so it''s assigned a negative sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly neutral, with
    some positive and negative sentiments balanced out.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Tokens with multiple possible sentiment interpretations
    are disambiguated based on their context.

    6. Handling Negation: Negated tokens like "not good" are flipped to have a negative
    sentiment score.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: Intensified tokens like "very good" are not present
    in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: Emoticons and special characters
    like :) and :( are not present in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Tokens not recognized by the sentiment analysis
    model are considered neutral.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The context of surrounding tokens is considered
    to determine the sentiment of each token.


    The overall sentiment score is mostly neutral, with some positive and negative
    sentiments balanced out. Therefore, I classify the input text as "neutral".'
