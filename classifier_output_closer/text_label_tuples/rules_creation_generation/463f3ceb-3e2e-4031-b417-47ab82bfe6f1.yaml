- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\" and\
    \ 78 wounded. _Tel-el-Kebir_ was an example of a Night March in battle formation\
    \ of a force of 11,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, and 60 guns, to attack an entrenched\
    \ position at dawn, the object being to surprise the enemy and to cross the danger\
    \ zone without exposing the assaulting troops to a prolonged fire action. It resulted\
    \ in a victory which decided the Egyptian campaign, and added the Nile Valley\
    \ to the British Empire. Sir Garnet Wolesley's force advanced in four columns\
    \ marching abreast, with its left resting on the railway, and was successfully\
    \ carried out, the troops reaching a position, varying from 300 to 900 yards distance\
    \ from the objective, the assault being delivered at the conclusion of the march.\
    \ The Egyptian Army, under Arabi Pasha, fought steadily, and again and again renewed\
    \ the fight, after falling back {152} within their entrenchments, but their flank\
    \ was turned and the whole position captured. The British loss was only 459 all\
    \ ranks, and the Egyptians lost upwards of 2,500 killed and wounded, the remaining\
    \ 23,000 being dispersed or captured. A daylight advance and assault of so strong\
    \ a position could not have been successfully carried through at so small a cost\
    \ to the attacking troops. In the South African War there were two examples of\
    \ the unsuccessful Night Attack. Major-General Gatacre essayed a Night March followed\
    \ by a Night Attack upon the Boers' position at _Stormberg_ (December 10, 1899),\
    \ but he was misled by his guides in unknown ground and was himself surprised\
    \ by the Boers and forced to retire with a loss of over 700 officers and other\
    \ ranks. On the following day Lord Methuen delivered an attack upon Cronje's position\
    \ between the Upper Modder River and the Kimberley road. In a Night Attack on\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text does not contain sentiment-bearing words like
    "happy", "good", "great", "bad", "terrible", etc.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text describes historical events and military battles,
    which do not express a clear positive or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: Since the text does not contain sentiment-bearing words
    and does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment, the overall sentiment
    score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is present in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negation is present in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers are present in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are present in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are present in
    the text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain contextual dependencies
    that would affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it does not contain sentiment-bearing
    words, does not express a clear positive or negative sentiment, and does not contain
    any ambiguity, negation, intensifiers, emoticons, special characters, out-of-vocabulary
    words, or contextual dependencies that would affect the sentiment analysis.'
