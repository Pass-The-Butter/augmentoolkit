- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Certainly\
    \ there would be losses, for the Germans have surrounded their works with numerous\
    \ anti-aircraft guns, but would the more or less complete destruction of the Essen\
    \ works be too dearly bought by the loss of a number of machines? Moreover we\
    \ do not believe that a raid on their big plants, if well prepared and well carried\
    \ out, would be very costly.The use of aviation to destroy the enemy\u2019s munition\
    \ plants will, in our opinion, greatly hasten the end of the war, and spare a\
    \ large number of lives.If the war lasts, the long-distance aviation will have\
    \ to be employed very extensively during the summer to set fire indiscriminately\
    \ to the harvest in the enemy\u2019s country, and even in the territory which\
    \ they occupy as invaders, since there is no reason to spare the invaded sections\
    \ as long as the natives are not allowed to have their share of the crops. Furthermore,\
    \ devices will have to be invented to facilitate this work of destruction.It is\
    \ materially impossible to give the bombing-machines a speed equal to that of\
    \ the battle-planes. Great importance however must be attached to the choice of\
    \ motors and to obtaining the greatest speed possible.All these machines have\
    \ two propellers and some are provided with three motors.The first bombing expeditions\
    \ were undertaken during the first months of the war. From the very beginning,\
    \ the Germans realized that airplanes could go far and strike dangerous blows.\
    \ Paris was bombarded as early as September, 1914. In time, and as the machines\
    \ were improved, the bombardments became more disastrous. In the course of the\
    \ first half of 1915, British aviators dropped bombs on Friedrichshaven, the Zeppelin\
    \ station on the Lake of Constance; French aviators attacked Stuttgart and Carlsruhe;\
    \ and since the beginning of 1917, the Germans have multiplied their raids on\
    \ London and the coasts of England.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified, and
    sentiment scores are assigned. For example, "losses", "destruction", "costly",
    "hasten", "spare", "invaders", "destroy", "dreadful" have negative sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, "raid on their big plants" is part of a sentence that
    expresses a negative sentiment, so it gets a negative sentiment score.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is negative due to the
    presence of negative sentiment-bearing words and phrases.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Tokens with multiple possible sentiment interpretations
    are disambiguated using contextual analysis.

    6. Handling Negation: Negated tokens are flipped to have the opposite sentiment
    score.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: Intensified tokens have their sentiment scores increased.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: Emoticons and special characters
    that convey sentiment are considered as additional sentiment-bearing tokens.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Unrecognized tokens are considered as neutral
    tokens.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: Contextual dependencies between tokens are
    captured using contextual analysis.


    The overall sentiment score is negative, indicating that the text is classified
    as "negative".'
