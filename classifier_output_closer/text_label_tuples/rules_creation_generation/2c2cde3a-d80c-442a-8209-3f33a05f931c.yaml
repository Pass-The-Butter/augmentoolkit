- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"V.\
    \ \"Let us suppose a nation to abandon all means both of offence and of defence,\
    \ to lay aside all power of inflicting injury, and to rely for self-preservation\
    \ solely upon the justice of its own conduct, and the moral effect which such\
    \ a course of conduct would produce upon the consciences of men. * * * * How would\
    \ such a nation be protected from external attack, and entire subjugation? I answer,\
    \ by adopting the law of benevolence, a nation would render such an event in the\
    \ highest degree improbable. The causes of national war are, most commonly, the\
    \ love of plunder and the love of glory. The first of these is rarely, if ever,\
    \ sufficient to stimulate men to the _ferocity necessary to war_, unless when\
    \ assisted by the second. And by adopting as the rule of our conduct the law of\
    \ benevolence, all motive arising from the second cause is taken away. There is\
    \ not a nation in Europe that could be led on to war against a harmless, just,\
    \ forgiving, and defenceless people.\"History teaches us that societies as well\
    \ as individuals have been attacked again and again notwithstanding that they\
    \ either would not or could not defend themselves. Did Mr. White, of Salem, escape\
    \ his murderers any the more for being harmless and defenceless? Did the Quakers\
    \ escape being attacked and hung by the ancient New Englanders any the more because\
    \ of their non-resisting principles? Have the Jews escaped persecutions throughout\
    \ Christendom any the more because of their imbecility and non-resistance for\
    \ some centuries past? Poland was comparatively harmless and defenceless when\
    \ the three great European powers combined to attack and destroy the entire nation,\
    \ dividing between themselves the Polish territory, and enslaving or driving into\
    \ exile the Polish people.\"Oh, bloodiest picture in the book of time,   Sarmatia\
    \ fell, unwept, without a crime!\"\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the text as \"negative\".\n\nHere's\
    \ the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or\
    \ tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified, such\
    \ as \"harmless\", \"just\", \"forgiving\", \"defenceless\", \"bloodiest\", \"\
    unwept\", and \"without a crime\". These tokens are assigned sentiment scores:\n\
    \t+ Positive: 0 (most tokens are neutral or have mixed sentiment)\n\t+ Negative:\
    \ -1 (tokens like \"bloodiest\", \"unwept\", and \"without a crime\" have negative\
    \ sentiment)\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is considered:\n\
    \t+ Phrases like \"harmless, just, forgiving, and defenceless people\" and \"\
    non-resisting principles\" express a negative sentiment, as they describe a nation's\
    \ inability to defend itself.\n\t+ The quote \"Oh, bloodiest picture in the book\
    \ of time, Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime!\" is a vivid description of\
    \ a tragic event, which has a strong negative sentiment.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens. The negative sentiment scores outweigh the neutral ones,\
    \ resulting in a negative overall sentiment.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous\
    \ tokens are identified.\n6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are identified.\n\
    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are identified.\n8. Handling Emoticons\
    \ and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters are identified that\
    \ convey sentiment.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary\
    \ words are identified.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies\
    \ are identified.\n\nThe text expresses a strong negative sentiment, describing\
    \ the tragic fate of nations that are unable to defend themselves and the devastating\
    \ consequences of war."
