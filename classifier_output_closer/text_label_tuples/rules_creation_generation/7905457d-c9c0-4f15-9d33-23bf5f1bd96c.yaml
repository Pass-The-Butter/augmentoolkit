- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Prince\
    \ Eugene and Marlborough would never have been so successful in the campaigns\
    \ which they directed in concert, if a spirit of intrigue and difference of opinion\
    \ had not constantly disorganized the armies opposed to them.MAXIM LXV.The same\
    \ consequences which have uniformly attended long discussions and councils of\
    \ war, will follow at all times. They will terminate in the adoption of the worst\
    \ course, which in war is always the most timid, or, if you will, the most prudent.\
    \ The only true wisdom in a general is determined courage.NOTE.Prince Eugene used\
    \ to say that councils of war \u201Care only useful when you want an excuse for\
    \ attempting _nothing_.\u201D This was also the opinion of Villars. A general-in-chief\
    \ should avoid, therefore, assembling a council on occasions of difficulty, and\
    \ should confine himself to consulting separately his most experienced generals\
    \ in order to benefit by their advice, while he is governed at the same time in\
    \ his decision by his own judgment. By this means, he becomes responsible, it\
    \ is true, for the measures he pursues; but he has the advantage also of acting\
    \ upon his own conviction, and of being certain that the secret of his operations\
    \ will not be divulged, as is usually the case where it is discussed by a council\
    \ of war.MAXIM LXVI.In war, the general alone can judge of certain arrangements.\
    \ It depends on him alone to conquer difficulties by his own superior talents\
    \ and resolution.NOTE.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like\
    \ \"successful\", \"intrigue\", \"difference\", \"opinion\", \"worst\", \"timid\"\
    , \"prudent\", \"courage\", \"excuse\", \"nothing\", \"difficulty\", \"judgment\"\
    , \"conviction\", \"secret\", \"operations\", \"conquer\", and \"resolution\"\
    . These words are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g., \"successful\"\
    , \"courage\", \"resolution\")\n\t* Negative: -1 (e.g., \"intrigue\", \"difference\"\
    , \"opinion\", \"conquer\")\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g., \"excuse\", \"nothing\", \"\
    difficulty\", \"judgment\", \"conviction\", \"secret\", \"operations\")\n3. Contextual\
    \ Analysis: The text is analyzed in context to determine the overall sentiment.\
    \ The text discusses military strategy and tactics, and the sentiment-bearing\
    \ words are used to classify the text as neutral.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation: The\
    \ overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of\
    \ individual tokens. Since the text contains both positive and negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words, the overall sentiment score is neutral.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous\
    \ tokens are found in the text.\n6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found\
    \ in the text.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found in the\
    \ text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special\
    \ characters that convey sentiment are found in the text.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary\
    \ Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found in the text.\n10. Handling Contextual\
    \ Dependencies: The text's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens,\
    \ which is captured through contextual analysis.\n\nThe text is classified as\
    \ \"neutral\" because it discusses military strategy and tactics without expressing\
    \ a clear positive or negative sentiment."
