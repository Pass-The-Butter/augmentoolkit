- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"I\
    \ do not believe any other suppositions could be made, unless the Prussians were\
    \ thought to be so foolish as to divide their forces, already inferior to the\
    \ French, upon the two directions of Wesel and Mayence,--a useless mistake, since\
    \ there had not been a French soldier on the first of these roads since the Seven\
    \ Years' War.These hypotheses having been made as above stated, if any one should\
    \ ask what course Napoleon ought to pursue, it was easy to reply \"that the mass\
    \ of the French army being already assembled in Bavaria, it should be thrown upon\
    \ the left of the Prussians by way of Grera and Hof, for the gordian knot of the\
    \ campaign was in that direction, no matter what plan they should adopt.\"If they\
    \ advanced to Erfurt, he could move to Gera, cut their line of retreat, and press\
    \ them back along the Lower Elbe to the North Sea. If they rested upon the Saale,\
    \ he could attack their left by way of Hof and Gera, defeat them partially, and\
    \ reach Berlin before them by way of Leipsic. If they stood fast behind the Elbe,\
    \ he must still attack them by way of Gera and Hof.Since Napoleon's direction\
    \ of operations was so clearly fixed, what mattered it to him to know the details\
    \ of their movements? Being certain of the correctness of these principles, I\
    \ did not hesitate to announce, _a month before the war_, that Napoleon would\
    \ attempt just what he did, and that if the Prussians passed the Saale battles\
    \ would take place at Jena and Naumburg!I relate this circumstance not from a\
    \ feeling of vanity, for if that were my motive I might mention many more of a\
    \ similar character. I have only been anxious to show that in war a plan of operations\
    \ may be often arranged, simply based upon the general principles of the art,\
    \ without much attention being of necessity given to the details of the enemy's\
    \ movements.\"\"\""

    \ Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment-bearing words are identified,\
    \ and sentiment scores are assigned:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g., \"good\", \"great\"\
    )\n\t* Negative: -1 (e.g., \"bad\", \"terrible\")\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g., \"the\"\
    , \"and\")\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed:\n\t\
    * Phrases or sentences that express a positive sentiment are assigned a positive\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t* Phrases or sentences that express a negative sentiment\
    \ are assigned a negative sentiment score.\n\t* Phrases or sentences that are\
    \ neutral or unclear are assigned a neutral sentiment score.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: Tokens with multiple possible\
    \ sentiment interpretations are disambiguated using contextual analysis.\n6. Handling\
    \ Negation: Negated tokens are flipped to their opposite sentiment score.\n7.\
    \ Handling Intensifiers: Intensified tokens have their sentiment score increased.\n\
    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: Emoticons and special characters\
    \ that convey sentiment are considered as additional sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\
    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Unrecognized tokens are considered as neutral\
    \ tokens.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The sentiment of tokens depends\
    \ on the context of surrounding tokens, which is captured using contextual analysis.\n\
    \nThe text is primarily focused on discussing military strategy and tactics, with\
    \ no obvious emotional language or sentiment-bearing words. The sentiment scores\
    \ are mostly neutral, with some positive and negative sentiment-bearing words\
    \ scattered throughout the text. However, the overall sentiment of the text is\
    \ neutral, as it is a historical analysis of military operations rather than an\
    \ emotional expression."
