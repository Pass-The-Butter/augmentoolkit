- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Again,\
    \ in 1814, a barbette battery of one four-pounder and two eighteen-pounder guns\
    \ at Stonington, repelled a British fleet of one hundred and thirty-four guns.\
    \ During the engagement the Americans exhausted their ammunition, and spiked their\
    \ eighteen-pounders, and only one of them was afterwards used. Two of the enemy's\
    \ ships, carrying one hundred and twelve guns, were engaged during the whole time\
    \ of attack, and during much of this time bombarded the town from a position beyond\
    \ reach of the land-battery. They were entirely too far off for the four-pounder\
    \ gun to be of any use. Supposing the two eighteen-pounders to have been employed\
    \ during the whole action, and also all the guns of the fleet, _one_ eighteen-pounder\
    \ on land must have been more than equivalent to _sixty-seven_ guns afloat, for\
    \ the ships were so much injured as to render it necessary for them to withdraw.\
    \ The British loss was twenty killed, and more than fifty wounded. Ours was only\
    \ two killed and six wounded.[20][Footnote 20: Perkins says two killed and six\
    \ wounded. Holmes says six wounded, but makes no mention of any killed.]The fleet\
    \ sent to the attack of Baltimore, in 1814, consisted of forty sail, the largest\
    \ of which were ships of the line, carrying an army of over six thousand combatants.\
    \ The troops were landed at North Point, while sixteen of the bomb-vessels and\
    \ frigates approached within reach of Fort McHenry, and commenced a bombardment\
    \ which lasted twenty-five hours. During this attack, the enemy threw \"fifteen\
    \ hundred shells, four hundred of which exploded within the walls of the fort,\
    \ but without making any impression on either the strength of the work or the\
    \ garrison,\" and the British were compelled to retire with much loss.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the text as \"positive\".\n\nHere's\
    \ the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or\
    \ tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as \"repelled\"\
    , \"exhausted\", \"spiked\", \"engaged\", \"bombarded\", \"injured\", \"withdraw\"\
    , \"killed\", \"wounded\", \"approached\", \"commenced\", \"attack\", \"compelled\"\
    , and \"retire\". These words have sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g. \"\
    repelled\", \"engaged\", \"bombarded\", \"injured\", \"withdraw\")\n\t* Negative:\
    \ -1 (e.g. \"exhausted\", \"spiked\", \"killed\", \"wounded\")\n\t* Neutral: 0\
    \ (e.g. \"approached\", \"commenced\", \"attack\", \"compelled\", \"retire\")\n\
    3. Contextual Analysis: The text's context is analyzed to determine the sentiment\
    \ of each token. For example, the phrase \"repelled a British fleet\" has a positive\
    \ sentiment, while the phrase \"exhausted their ammunition\" has a negative sentiment.\n\
    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing\
    \ up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The positive sentiment scores\
    \ outweigh the negative sentiment scores, resulting in a positive overall sentiment\
    \ score.\n5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.\n\
    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.\n7. Handling Intensifiers:\
    \ No intensified tokens are found in the text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters: No emoticons or special characters that convey sentiment are found\
    \ in the text.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words\
    \ are found in the text.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text's context\
    \ is analyzed to capture dependencies between tokens, but no complex dependencies\
    \ are found.\n\nOverall, the text is classified as \"positive\" due to the prevalence\
    \ of positive sentiment-bearing words and phrases, such as \"repelled\", \"engaged\"\
    , \"bombarded\", and \"injured\", which outweigh the negative sentiment-bearing\
    \ words and phrases."
