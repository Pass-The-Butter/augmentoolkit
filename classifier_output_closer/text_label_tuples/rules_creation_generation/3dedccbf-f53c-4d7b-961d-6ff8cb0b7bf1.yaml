- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"THE\
    \ DECISIVE BLOW.--The preparatory action and the development usually take the\
    \ form of a converging movement of separated forces, so timed as to strike the\
    \ adversary's front and flank simultaneously, in order to threaten the enemy's\
    \ line of communications, for the line of supply is as vital to the existence\
    \ of an army as the heart to the life of a human being. \"Perhaps no situation\
    \ is more pitiable than that of a commander who has permitted an enemy to sever\
    \ his communications. He sees the end of his resources at hand, but not the means\
    \ to replenish them\" (General Sir E. B. Hamley). The decisive blow will be delivered\
    \ by the General Reserve, which will be secretly concentrated and launched as\
    \ secretly as possible; and the commander of the whole force will so distribute\
    \ his troops that about half his available force can be kept in hand for this\
    \ decisive blow, on a part of the enemy's front if sufficient penetration has\
    \ been effected, or on a flank. The point chosen becomes the vital {32} point,\
    \ and success there means success at all points. Once routed, the enemy must be\
    \ relentlessly pursued and prevented from regaining order and moral.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "decisive", "vital", "pitiable", "secretly", "relentlessly" have positive
    sentiment. Tokens like "enemy" and "adversary" have neutral sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. For example, "decisive
    blow" and "vital point" have positive sentiment in the context of a military strategy.
    "Pitiable" has a negative sentiment in the context of a commander''s situation.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is positive due to the
    presence of positive sentiment-bearing words and phrases.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are identified.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are identified.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are identified.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    are identified that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are identified.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The context of surrounding tokens is captured
    to analyze the sentiment of each token.


    The text is classified as "positive" because it describes a military strategy
    and uses words and phrases with positive sentiment, such as "decisive blow", "vital
    point", and "relentlessly".'
