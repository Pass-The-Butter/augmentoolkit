- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"But\
    \ in a real charge, all your ranks are attentive, restless, anxious about what\
    \ is taking place at the front and, if the latter halts, if the first line stops,\
    \ there will be a movement to the rear and not to the front. Take a good battalion,\
    \ possessed of extraordinary calmness and coolness, thrown full speed on the enemy,\
    \ at one hundred and twenty steps to the minute. To-day it would have to advance\
    \ under a fire of five shots a minute! At this last desperate moment if the front\
    \ rank stops, it will not be pushed, according to the theory of successive impulses,\
    \ it will be upset. The second line will arrive only to fall over the first and\
    \ so on. There should be a drill ground test to see up to what rank this falling\
    \ of the pasteboard figures would extend.Physical impulse is merely a word. If\
    \ the front rank stops it will let itself fall and be trampled under foot rather\
    \ than cede to the pressure that pushes it forward. Any one experienced in infantry\
    \ engagements of to-day knows that is just what happens. This shows the error\
    \ of the theory of physical impulse--a theory that continues to dictate as under\
    \ the Empire (so strong is routine and prejudice) attacks in close column. Such\
    \ attacks are marked by absolute disorder and lack of leadership. Take a battalion\
    \ fresh from barracks, in light marching order; intent only on the maneuver to\
    \ be executed. It marches in close column in good order; its subdivisions are\
    \ full four paces apart. The non-commissioned officers control the men. But it\
    \ is true that if the terrain is slightly accidented, if the guide does not march\
    \ with mathematical precision, the battalion in close column becomes in the twinkling\
    \ of an eye a flock of sheep. What would happen to a battalion in such a formation,\
    \ at one hundred paces from the enemy? Nobody will ever see such an instance in\
    \ these days of the rifle.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the text as \"negative\".\n\nHere's\
    \ the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or\
    \ tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as \"anxious\"\
    , \"restless\", \"desperate\", \"error\", and \"disorder\", which are assigned\
    \ sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: 0\n\t* Negative: -1\n\t* Neutral: 0\n3. Contextual\
    \ Analysis: The text is analyzed in context to determine the sentiment of each\
    \ token. For example, \"anxious\" is part of a phrase that expresses a negative\
    \ sentiment, so it is assigned a negative sentiment score.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens. The score is:\n\t* Negative: -1 (from \"anxious\", \"\
    restless\", \"desperate\", and \"error\")\n\t* Neutral: 0 (from other tokens)\n\
    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is detected in the text.\n6. Handling Negation:\
    \ No negation is detected in the text.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers\
    \ are detected in the text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No\
    \ emoticons or special characters are detected in the text.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary\
    \ Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are detected in the text.\n10. Handling Contextual\
    \ Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are detected in the text.\n\nThe overall\
    \ sentiment score is negative, indicating that the text is classified as \"negative\"\
