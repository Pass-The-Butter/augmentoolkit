- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\" long\
    \ as there are good, hard roads to follow; but enemies have an unpleasant way\
    \ of going away from the roads into hills and mountains, or across trackless plains,\
    \ and there is where the mule is not merely valuable, but absolutely essential.\
    \ These pack animals can keep up, not only with the infantry, but also with fast-moving\
    \ bodies of mounted troops. The \u201Cpackers\u201D of the American army are civilian\
    \ _attach\xE9s_, but they are a very essential part of the force. They are nearly\
    \ all men from the West, and are generally of the cow-puncher stamp, afraid of\
    \ nothing, not even of work. These packers did some of the most heroic work during\
    \ the Santiago campaign, although they never got any credit for it, and are seldom\
    \ mentioned in despatches. They are to the army what the stokers are to the navy--the\
    \ very means of life; yet bound to go on doing that hard, undistinguished work,\
    \ with no applause from the great unthinking public. They are never seen in parades\
    \ and reviews, yet to them belongs a great portion of the credit for these displays.\
    \ The packers of the army are accustomed to go into the very firing line to deliver\
    \ ammunition. It is indeed a memorable sight to witness these men in action, and\
    \ to watch their indifference to the danger that is singing about their heads.\
    \ Very picturesque are these Western packers, with their happy abandon and their\
    \ oblivion to worry. They wear no uniform, they have no regiment to be proud of;\
    \ they are just plain, good-natured, hard-working civilians of the great West.\
    \ The only arms they carry are their own Colts, just as they carried them in New\
    \ Mexico or Montana.\"\"\""
