- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"_France._[121]\
    \ According to the French Field Artillery Regulations (footnote to par. 277),\
    \ a gun firing time shrapnel covers effectively a front of 25 m., and a battery\
    \ of four pieces, a front of 100 m. This intensity of fire, which is obtained\
    \ when each piece fires one shot with proper corrector and range settings (the\
    \ battery four shots) Aubrat calls \u201C_Density 4_.\u201D When _rafale_ fire\
    \ (two shots per piece) is employed against a front of 100 m., with proper corrector\
    \ setting, density 8 is obtained. When the front exceeds 100 m., the deflection\
    \ of the pieces must be changed between successive shots (_tir avec fauchage_).\
    \ To obtain density 8 against a front of 150 m., each piece must fire three shots,\
    \ as prescribed in the regulations. When progressive fire (_tir progressif_) is\
    \ employed, four different ranges are given, of which only one can be considered\
    \ effective. When not sweeping, in this fire, each piece fires two shots, thus\
    \ also obtaining a density of 8. A density of 1 always corresponds, therefore,\
    \ to one round, fired, with proper corrector and range settings, against a front\
    \ of 100 m. When a battery (four pieces) fires one salvo against a target having\
    \ a front of 50 m., density 8 is obtained; by firing two salvos, density 16 is\
    \ obtained.[121] The following is taken from Lieutenant-General ROHNE\u2019S essay\
    \  on the work of Squadron Commander AUBRAT, _Les exercices de service  en campagne_.\
    \ The essay mentioned appeared in the December, 1907,  number of _Artilleristische\
    \ Monatsschriften_.The _Commission d\u2019\xE9tudes pratiques du tir_ has made\
    \ a thorough investigation into the effect produced by shrapnel fire. The following\
    \ table gives a general idea of the effect to be expected when firing against\
    \ service targets (_i.e._, the percentage of figures one may expect to hit when\
    \ employing fire of varying density):\"\"\""

- content: I would classify the input text as "neutral". The text appears to be a
    technical description of artillery fire and its effects, without any emotional
    language or sentiment-bearing words. The text is written in a formal and objective
    tone, and does not contain any words or phrases that would suggest a positive
    or negative sentiment. The text is primarily focused on providing information
    and data about artillery fire, and does not express any opinion or emotion.
