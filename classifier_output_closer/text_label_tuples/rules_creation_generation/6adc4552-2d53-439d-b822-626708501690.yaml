- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Thirdly,\
    \ it is a disputed point how far the influence of policy is theoretically allowable\
    \ during the course of actual operations, _i.e._ after the war has actually begun.\
    \ Moltke's opinion was that policy should only act at the beginning and at the\
    \ end of a war, and should keep clear during the actual operations. Clausewitz,\
    \ however, holds that the two are so intimately related that the political influence\
    \ cannot be lost sight of even during actual operations. Between two such authorities\
    \ we may well hesitate to give a definite opinion, and must seek for the middle\
    \ way. Undoubtedly, in history policy often has really affected the actual operations,\
    \ as in 1812, 1813, 1814, 1864, Macmahon's march to Sedan, or Bismarck's interference\
    \ to hurry on the siege of Paris in 1870, or Ladysmith in the Boer War, and in\
    \ many other cases. That, we must admit. We must also admit that its interference\
    \ frequently produces a weakening effect on the operations. Clausewitz says that\
    \ that only occurs when the policy itself is wrong. Perhaps. But the safest middle\
    \ way rule appears to be this, that policy should be dominant at the beginning\
    \ and end of a war, but during actual operations the statesman should exercise\
    \ the greatest possible restraint, and avoid all interference, except when demanded\
    \ by _overwhelming political necessity_.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like\
    \ \"disputed\", \"allowable\", \"intimately\", \"related\", \"hesitate\", \"undoubtedly\"\
    , \"affected\", \"weakening\", \"wrong\", and \"necessity\". These words are assigned\
    \ sentiment scores as follows:\n\t* Positive: 0\n\t* Negative: 0\n\t* Neutral:\
    \ 0\n3. Contextual Analysis: The text is analyzed to determine the context of\
    \ each token. The sentiment scores are adjusted based on the context. For example,\
    \ the token \"disputed\" is part of a sentence that expresses a neutral sentiment,\
    \ so it is assigned a neutral sentiment score.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation: The\
    \ overall sentiment score for the text is calculated by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens. The score is:\n\t* Positive: 0\n\t* Negative: 0\n\
    \t* Neutral: 0\n5. Handling Ambiguity: The text does not contain any ambiguous\
    \ tokens that require disambiguation.\n6. Handling Negation: The text does not\
    \ contain any negated tokens that require flipping of sentiment scores.\n7. Handling\
    \ Intensifiers: The text does not contain any intensified tokens that require\
    \ adjustment of sentiment scores.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters:\
    \ The text does not contain any emoticons or special characters that convey sentiment.\n\
    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: The text does not contain any out-of-vocabulary\
    \ words that require special handling.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies:\
    \ The text does not contain any contextual dependencies that require special handling.\n\
    \nBased on the analysis, the overall sentiment of the text is neutral, as there\
    \ are no sentiment-bearing words or phrases that convey a strong positive or negative\
    \ sentiment. The text appears to be a neutral discussion of a military strategy,\
    \ with no emotional tone or bias."
