- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The\
    \ last Sunday before the British came dawned quiet and peaceful as a New England\
    \ Sabbath; not a sign of war was to be seen; the streets were thronged with men,\
    \ women, and children on their way to church to pray for their cause and their\
    \ dead. The soldier laid aside his rifle and bandolier for the day, and not one\
    \ was to be seen throughout the crowds which were moving towards their respective\
    \ places of worship, while the bells rang summons and welcome. The day was warm\
    \ enough for the women to wear white gowns, which served to make the many black\
    \ ones the more noticeable. The children were stiff and starched in their Sunday\
    \ cleanliness, and half the church-going crowd was composed of these little ones.\
    \ In many a pew there was no father or brother, but only a sad-faced woman in\
    \ sombre black.The churches were crowded to the doors, and I tried two or three\
    \ places before I finally gained admittance to the church opposite President Kr\xFC\
    ger\u2019s house, where he had himself often occupied the pulpit. It was a typical\
    \ country church, such as may be seen in hundreds of our smaller towns; the windows\
    \ were open, and a soft breeze blew gently through the room. The people entered\
    \ deeply into their worship, and the sadness that prevailed made it appear like\
    \ a service over the dead who had fallen in battle. Many families were worshiping\
    \ together for the last time, for on the morrow a battle was to be fought, and\
    \ all who were going to continue the fight were to be separated that night from\
    \ their loved ones.[Illustration: Boers under heavy shell fire, awaiting British\
    \ advance behind their defenses.][Illustration: Burghers\u2019 horses during battle\

- content: "After applying the rules, I classify the input text as \"neutral\".\n\n\
    Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words\
    \ or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The tokens are analyzed for sentiment-bearing words. Some\
    \ examples of sentiment-bearing words in the text include \"quiet\", \"peaceful\"\
    , \"sad-faced\", and \"sadness\". These words are assigned a sentiment score:\n\
    \t* \"quiet\" and \"peaceful\" are neutral (0)\n\t* \"sad-faced\" and \"sadness\"\
    \ are negative (-1)\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed\
    \ to determine its sentiment. For example, the phrase \"not a sign of war was\
    \ to be seen\" is neutral, while the phrase \"the sadness that prevailed made\
    \ it appear like a service over the dead who had fallen in battle\" is negative.\n\
    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing\
    \ up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The text has a mix of positive,\
    \ negative, and neutral sentiment, but the negative sentiment is more prominent.\n\
    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.\n6. Handling\
    \ Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.\n7. Handling Intensifiers:\
    \ No intensified tokens are found in the text.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters: No emoticons or special characters that convey sentiment are found\
    \ in the text.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words\
    \ are found in the text.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text's sentiment\
    \ depends on the context of surrounding tokens, which is captured through contextual\
    \ analysis.\n\nOverall, the text is classified as \"neutral\" because it has a\
    \ mix of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, but the negative sentiment\
    \ is more prominent."
