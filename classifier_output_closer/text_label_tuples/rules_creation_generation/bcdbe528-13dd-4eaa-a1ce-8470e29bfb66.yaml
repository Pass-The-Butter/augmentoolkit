- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Napoleon\
    \ I said that in battle, the r\xF4le of skirmishers is the most fatiguing and\
    \ most deadly. This means that under the Empire, as at present, the strongly engaged\
    \ infantry troops rapidly dissolved into skirmishers. The action was decided by\
    \ the moral agency of the troops not engaged, held in hand, capable of movement\
    \ in any direction and acting as a great menace of new danger to the adversary,\
    \ already shaken by the destructive action of the skirmishers. The same is true\
    \ to-day. But the greater force of fire arms requires, more than ever, that they\
    \ be utilized. The r\xF4le of the skirmisher becomes pre\xEBminently the destructive\
    \ role; it is forced on every organization seriously engaged by the greater moral\
    \ pressure of to-day which causes men to scatter sooner.Commanders-in-chief imagine\
    \ formed battalions firing on the enemy and do not include the use of skirmishers\
    \ in drill. This is an error, for they are necessary in drill and everywhere,\
    \ etc. The formed rank is more difficult to utilize than ever. General Leboeuf\
    \ used a very practical movement of going into battle, by platoons, which advance\
    \ to the battle line in echelon, and can fire, even if they are taken in the very\
    \ act of the movement. There is always the same dangerous tendency toward mass\
    \ action even for a battalion in maneuver. This is an error. The principles of\
    \ maneuver for small units should not be confused with those for great units.\
    \ Emperor Napoleon did not prescribe skirmishers in flat country. But every officer\
    \ should be reduced who does not utilize them to some degree.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the text as \"neutral\".\n\nHere's\
    \ the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or\
    \ tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.\n\
    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like \"fatiguing\"\
    , \"deadly\", \"moral\", \"destructive\", \"error\", and \"danger\", which are\
    \ assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g., \"moral\", \"destructive\"\
    )\n\t* Negative: -1 (e.g., \"fatiguing\", \"deadly\", \"error\")\n\t* Neutral:\
    \ 0 (e.g., \"men\", \"units\", \"country\")\n3. Contextual Analysis: The text\
    \ is analyzed for context, and sentiment scores are adjusted accordingly:\n\t\
    * Phrases like \"the most fatiguing and most deadly\" and \"the destructive role\"\
    \ are assigned negative sentiment scores.\n\t* Phrases like \"the moral agency\
    \ of the troops\" and \"the greater moral pressure\" are assigned positive sentiment\
    \ scores.\n\t* Phrases like \"the use of skirmishers in drill\" and \"the principles\
    \ of maneuver\" are assigned neutral sentiment scores.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\
    \ The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment scores\
    \ of individual tokens. The score is:\n\t* Positive: +2 (from \"moral\" and \"\
    destructive\")\n\t* Negative: -2 (from \"fatiguing\", \"deadly\", and \"error\"\

    \ No ambiguous tokens are found.\n6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are\
    \ found.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.\n8. Handling\
    \ Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment are found.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary\
    \ words are found.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies\
