    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Some\
    \ of my critics have disputed as to the meaning of words and upon definitions;\
    \ others have censured where they but imperfectly understood; and others have,\
    \ by the light of certain important events, taken it upon themselves to deny my\
    \ fundamental principles, without inquiring whether the conditions of the case\
    \ which might modify the application of these principles were such as were supposed,\
    \ or without reflecting that, even admitting what they claimed to be true, a single\
    \ exception cannot disprove a rule based upon the experience of ages and upon\
    \ natural principles.In opposition to my maxims upon interior lines, some have\
    \ quoted the famous and successful march of the allies upon Leipsic. This remarkable\
    \ event, at first glance, seems to stagger the faith of those who believe in principles.\
    \ At best, however, it is but one of those exceptional cases from which nothing\
    \ can be inferred in the face of thousands of opposed instances. Moreover, it\
    \ is easy to show that, far from overthrowing the maxims it has been brought to\
    \ oppose, it will go to establish their soundness. Indeed, the critics had forgotten\
    \ that in case of a considerable numerical superiority I recommended double lines\
    \ of operations as most advantageous, particularly when concentric and arranged\
    \ to combine an effort against the enemy at the decisive moment. Now, in the allied\
    \ armies of Schwarzenberg, Bl\xFCcher, Bernadotte, and Benningsen, this case of\
    \ decided superiority is found. The inferior army, to conform to the principles\
    \ of this chapter, should have directed its efforts against one of the extremities\
    \ of his adversary, and not upon the center as it did: so that the events quoted\
    \ against me are doubly in my favor.\"\"\""
