- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"It\
    \ is impossible to attribute numerical value to each of these various factors,\
    \ or to say that language everywhere counts for so much, religion for so much,\
    \ etc. We have to take each particular case and judge it as it stands. And if\
    \ we do that with an impartial judgment upon the real national feeling, we get\
    \ some such list as the following, for the Continent alone.(1) The French, who\
    \ within their own boundaries are perfectly united; although certain districts\
    \ (a little group in the Pyrenees and another little group in Western Brittany\
    \ and another in the extreme north-east) speak a language of their own. To this\
    \ French group should be added the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which were\
    \ annexed by the Germans in 1871. Alsace and Lorraine have enjoyed great material\
    \ prosperity under German rule; the metal industry of the North has been immensely\
    \ developed, and in a dozen other ways the German administration has increased\
    \ their wealth, and has added to their population serious elements of German sympathy.\
    \ But take the provinces as a whole and there is no doubt that their re-union\
    \ with France is still the passionate desire of the great majority among them.(2)\
    \ Belgium is again undoubtedly the example of a separate--though less united--national\
    \ group in whose individual feeling religion plays a great part, but still more\
    \ historic existence through nearly a century as an independent State (during\
    \ which century Belgium has vastly increased its population and its wealth), and\
    \ for much more than a century the separate existence of the district as the Southern\
    \ Netherlands as distinct from Holland.\"\"\""

- content: "After applying the rules, I classified the input text as \"neutral\".\n\
    \nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words like\
    \ \"impossible\", \"perfectly\", \"united\", \"great\", \"immensely\", \"developed\"\
    , \"increased\", \"passionate\", \"desire\", \"great\", and \"historic\". These\
    \ words are assigned sentiment scores:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g., \"great\", \"\
    immensely\", \"developed\")\n\t* Negative: -1 (none)\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g., \"\
    impossible\", \"perfectly\", \"united\")\n3. Contextual Analysis: The text is\
    \ analyzed to determine the context in which each token appears. The sentiment\
    \ scores are adjusted based on the context:\n\t* Positive: +1 (e.g., \"great material\
    \ prosperity\" and \"serious elements of German sympathy\" in the context of Alsace\
    \ and Lorraine)\n\t* Negative: -1 (none)\n\t* Neutral: 0 (e.g., \"the passionate\
    \ desire of the great majority\" in the context of Alsace and Lorraine)\n4. Sentiment\
    \ Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens. The score is:\n\t* Positive: +2 (from \"great\"\
    \ and \"immensely\")\n\t* Negative: -0 (none)\n\t* Neutral: -2 (from \"impossible\"\
    , \"perfectly\", and \"united\")\n5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is detected.\n\
    6. Handling Negation: No negation is detected.\n7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers\
    \ are detected.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or\
    \ special characters are detected.\n9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary\
    \ words are detected.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies\
    \ are detected.\n\nThe overall sentiment score is -2, which is closer to neutral\
    \ than positive or negative. Therefore, I classify the input text as \"neutral\"\
