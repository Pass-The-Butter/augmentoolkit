- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"5.\
    \ Formerly the operations of war were directed against towns, camps, and positions;\
    \ recently they have been directed only against organized armies, leaving out\
    \ of consideration all natural or artificial obstacles. The exclusive use of either\
    \ of these systems is faulty: the true course is a mean between these extremes.\
    \ Doubtless, it will always be of the first importance to destroy and disorganize\
    \ all the armies of the enemy in the field, and to attain this end it may be allowable\
    \ to pass the fortresses; but if the success be only partial it will be unwise\
    \ to push the invasion too far. Here, also, very much depends upon the situation\
    \ and respective strength of the armies and the spirit of the nations.If Austria\
    \ were the sole antagonist of France, she could not follow in the footsteps of\
    \ the allies in 1814; neither is it probable that fifty thousand French will very\
    \ soon risk themselves beyond the Noric Alps, in the very heart of Austria, as\
    \ Napoleon did in 1797.[21] Such events only occur under exceptional circumstances.6.\
    \ It may be concluded from what precedes,--1st, that, while fortified places are\
    \ essential supports, abuse in their application may, by dividing an army, weaken\
    \ it instead of adding to its efficiency; 2d, that an army may, with the view\
    \ of destroying the enemy, pass the line of these forts,--always, however, leaving\
    \ a force to observe them; 3d, that an army cannot pass a large river, like the\
    \ Danube or the Rhine, without reducing at least one of the fortresses on the\
    \ river, in order to secure a good line of retreat. Once master of this place,\
    \ the army may advance on the offensive, leaving detachments to besiege other\
    \ places; and the chances of the reduction of those places increase as the army\
    \ advances, since the enemy's opportunities of hindering the siege are correspondingly\
    \ diminished.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "good", "bad", "weak", "strong", etc. which have sentiment
    scores assigned to them.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked to determine its
    sentiment score. Some phrases or sentences express positive sentiment, while others
    express negative or neutral sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly neutral, with
    some positive and negative sentiments balanced out.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Some tokens have multiple possible sentiment interpretations,
    but contextual analysis helps disambiguate the sentiment.

    6. Handling Negation: Some tokens are negated, but the sentiment score is flipped
    accordingly.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: Some tokens are intensified, but the sentiment score
    is increased accordingly.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: There are no emoticons or special
    characters that convey sentiment in this text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: There are no out-of-vocabulary words in this
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment depends on the context
    of surrounding tokens, which is captured through contextual analysis.


    Overall, the text''s sentiment is mostly neutral, with some positive and negative
    sentiments balanced out. Therefore, I classified the text as "neutral".'
