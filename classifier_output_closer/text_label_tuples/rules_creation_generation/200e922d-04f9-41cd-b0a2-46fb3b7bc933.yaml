- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"DISTANCE.--The\
    \ distance of the Outpost position from the troops protected is regulated by the\
    \ time the latter will require to prepare for action and by the importance of\
    \ preventing the enemy's field artillery from {132} approaching within effective\
    \ range of the ground on which these troops will deploy if attacked. Heavy guns\
    \ and mortars, although motor traction gives them great mobility, are unlikely\
    \ to accompany the enemy's Advanced Guard, and preparation to withstand or prevent\
    \ their fire will not usually be required from Outpost troops. The effective range\
    \ of shrapnel is 5,500 yards, the limit of the effective range of machine guns\
    \ is 2,000 yards, and of Lewis guns and rifles the effective limit is 1,400 yards.\
    \ The position on which the Main Body will deploy will thus be protected from\
    \ the shrapnel of field artillery, if the possible fire-positions of that arm\
    \ are brought under effective fire from machine guns 3,500 yards from the Position\
    \ of Deployment, with Lewis guns and rifles about 500 yards further forward. On\
    \ the other hand, especially in the case of small forces (against which artillery\
    \ will not be likely to be sent), the distance must not be such as would permit\
    \ of the Outposts being cut off, or as would necessitate the employment of an\
    \ undue proportion of men on Outpost duty.\"\"\""

- content: "I will classify the input text as \"neutral\".\n\nHere's the breakdown\
    \ of the classification:\n\n1. Tokenization:\n\t* Split the text into individual\
    \ words or tokens.\n\t* Remove punctuation marks, special characters, and stop\
    \ words.\n2. Sentiment Analysis:\n\t* The text contains words like \"distance\"\
    , \"regulated\", \"importance\", \"prevent\", \"unlikely\", \"required\", \"effective\"\
    , \"protected\", \"deploy\", \"fire\", \"machine\", \"Lewis\", \"rifles\", which\
    \ are neutral in sentiment.\n\t* There are no sentiment-bearing words like \"\

    \t* There is no emotional language or phrases that express a positive or negative\
    \ sentiment.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation:\n\t* The overall sentiment score is neutral,\
