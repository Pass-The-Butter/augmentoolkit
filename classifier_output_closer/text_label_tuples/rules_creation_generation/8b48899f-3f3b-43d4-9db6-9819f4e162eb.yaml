- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In\
    \ the greater number of battles, one party awaits his enemy in a position chosen\
    \ in advance, which is attacked after a reconnoissance as close and accurate as\
    \ possible. It often happens, however,--especially as war is now carried on,--that\
    \ two armies approach each other, each intending to make an unexpected attack\
    \ upon the other. A collision ensues unexpected by both armies, since each finds\
    \ the other where it does not anticipate a meeting. One army may also be attacked\
    \ by another which has prepared a surprise for it,--as happened to the French\
    \ at Rossbach.A great occasion of this kind calls into play all the genius of\
    \ a skillful general and of the warrior able to control events. It is always possible\
    \ to gain a battle with brave troops, even where the commander may not have great\
    \ capacity; but victories like those of Lutzen, Luzzara, Eylau, Abensberg, can\
    \ only be gained by a brilliant genius endowed with great coolness and using the\
    \ wisest combinations.There is so much chance in these accidental battles that\
    \ it is by no means easy to lay down precise rules concerning them; but these\
    \ are the very cases in which it is necessary to keep clearly before the mind\
    \ the fundamental principles of the art and the different methods of applying\
    \ them, in order to a proper arrangement of maneuvers that must be decided upon\
    \ at the instant and in the midst of the crash of resounding arms.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. Some
    tokens have words like "brave", "great", "cool", which are positive sentiment-bearing
    words. Others have words like "accidental", "chance", which are neutral sentiment-bearing
    words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is checked. Phrases like "brave
    troops" and "great capacity" express positive sentiment, while phrases like "accidental
    battles" and "chance" express neutral sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly neutral, with
    some positive and negative sentiment-bearing words.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are found.


    The overall sentiment score is neutral, with a slight leaning towards positive
    sentiment due to the presence of words like "brave" and "great". However, the
    text primarily contains neutral and objective language, describing military strategies
    and tactics, which leads me to classify the text as "neutral".'
