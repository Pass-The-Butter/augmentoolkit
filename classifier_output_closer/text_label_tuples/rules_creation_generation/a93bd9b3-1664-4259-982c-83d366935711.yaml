- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"Confidential\
    \ British instructions, dealing with the lessons learned  by the Japanese in Manchuria,\
    \ contain the following: \u201CIntrenched  artillery can be permanently silenced\
    \ only under very exceptional  circumstances, as it will withdraw its personnel\
    \ temporarily, as  soon as the hostile fire becomes too hot, and resume its fire\
    \ again  when that of the enemy abates. The infantry attack should therefore \
    \ be launched without awaiting the result of the artillery combat, but  the infantry\
    \ must insist upon the artillery completely engaging the  attention of the hostile\
    \ guns during the advance. Another reason for  not awaiting the outcome of the\
    \ artillery combat, lies in the great  frontage of battle lines. The unsuccessful\
    \ attack made by a division  will then frequently cause the neighboring unit to\
    \ make an immediate  attack.\u201D=Austria= (1904). \u201CThe artillery must be\
    \ given an opportunity and the  necessary time for effectively preparing the infantry\
    \ attack. So long  as the artillery engaged with the hostile batteries has not\
    \ achieved  a noticeable success, or is not at least neutralizing the hostile\
    \  artillery, the infantry attack remains a difficult undertaking.\u201D=France.=\
    \ The artillery during the preparatory stage of an action:  The artillery should\
    \ endeavor to silence the hostile artillery as  quickly as possible, without employing\
    \ more guns than are absolutely  necessary. The commander should give the order\
    \ for the attack only  when the preparation is considered sufficient.=England.=\
    \ The regulations emphasize the necessity of pushing  infantry forward, and of\
    \ supporting that infantry energetically, so  as to compel the defender to expose\
    \ himself. \u201CAs soon as the hostile  batteries have been sufficiently silenced,\
    \ or the infantry advances  to the attack, the fire is directed upon the point\
    \ of attack in order  to prepare and to cover the assault.\u201D\"\"\""

- content: 'Based on the rules provided, I will classify the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "lessons learned", "silenced",
    "hot", "abates", "advance", "attack", "neutralizing", "sufficient", "necessary",
    "energetically", and "compel", which are neutral or do not have a clear sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text discusses military strategies and tactics, and
    the language used is formal and objective. There is no clear expression of positive
    or negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as there is
    no dominant sentiment-bearing word or phrase.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous words are identified.

    6. Handling Negation: No negation is present in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers are present in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are present in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are identified.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s context is formal and objective,
    and there are no dependencies between tokens that would affect the sentiment analysis.


    Based on these rules, the input text is classified as "neutral".'
