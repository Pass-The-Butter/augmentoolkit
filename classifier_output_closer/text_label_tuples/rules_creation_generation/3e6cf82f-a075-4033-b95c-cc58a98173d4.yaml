- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"If,\
    \ for instance, instead of contenting ourselves with taking up every day the camp\
    \ the enemy has just vacated, occupying just as much of the country as he chooses\
    \ to abandon, we make our arrangements so as every day to encroach further, and\
    \ accordingly with our advance-guard organised for the purpose, attack his rear-guard\
    \ every time it attempts to halt, then such a course will hasten his retreat,\
    \ and consequently tend to increase his disorganisation.--This it will principally\
    \ effect by the character of continuous flight, which his retreat will thus assume.\
    \ Nothing has such a depressing influence on the soldier, as the sound of the\
    \ enemy's cannon afresh at the moment when, after a forced march he seeks some\
    \ rest; if this excitement is continued from day to day for some time, it may\
    \ lead to a complete rout. There lies in it a constant admission of being obliged\
    \ to obey the law of the enemy, and of being unfit for any resistance, and the\
    \ consciousness of this cannot do otherwise than weaken the moral of an Army in\
    \ a high degree. The effect of pressing the enemy in this way attains a maximum\
    \ when it drives the enemy to make night marches. If the conqueror scares away\
    \ the discomfited opponent at sunset from a camp which has just been taken up\
    \ either for the main body of the Army, or for the rear-guard, the conquered must\
    \ either make a night march, or alter his position in the night, retiring further\
    \ away, which is much the same thing; the victorious party can on the other hand\
    \ pass the night in quiet.The arrangement of marches, and the choice of positions\
    \ depend in this case also upon so many other things, especially on the supply\
    \ of the Army, on strong natural obstacles in the country, on large towns, &c.\
    \ &c., that it would be ridiculous pedantry to attempt to show by a geometrical\
    \ analysis how the pursuer, being able to impose his laws on the retreating enemy,\
    \ can comp\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "negative". Here''s
    the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "depressing", "weaken", "disorganisation", "complete rout", "unfit",
    "weakness" have negative sentiment scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. For example, phrases
    like "constant admission of being obliged to obey the law of the enemy" and "consciousness
    of this cannot do otherwise than weaken the moral of an Army" have negative sentiment
    scores.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is predominantly negative.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are identified.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are identified.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are identified.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    are identified that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are identified.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment depends on the context
    of surrounding tokens, which is captured through contextual analysis.


    The overall sentiment score is negative, indicating that the text is classified
    as "negative".'
