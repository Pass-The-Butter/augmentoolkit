- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"In\
    \ the invasion of Mexico, the United States formed four separate armies, moving\
    \ on _four distinct lines of operation:_ 1st. The \"Army of the West,\" under\
    \ General Kearny, moving from St. Louis on New Mexico and California; 2d. The\
    \ \"Army of the Centre,\" under General Wool, moving from San Antonio de Bexar\
    \ on Chihuahua; 3d. The \"Army of Occupation,\" on the Rio Grande, under General\
    \ Taylor, moving from Corpus Christi on Matamoras, Monterey, and Saltillo; and\
    \ 4th. The \"Main Army,\" under General Scott, moving from Vera Cruz on the capital\
    \ of Mexico.The Army of the West, under General Kearny, moved upon a separate\
    \ and distinct line of operations, having no strategic relations to the other\
    \ three; its objects were the conquest and occupation of New Mexico and Upper\
    \ California. The first was readily accomplished; but the general then detached\
    \ so large a force to operate on Chihuahua after the diversion of Wool's column,\
    \ that his expedition to California must have utterly failed without the assistance\
    \ of the naval forces in the Pacific.The lines of Taylor and Wool were evidently\
    \ ill chosen, being so distant as to afford the enemy an opportunity to take a\
    \ central position between them. Fortunately Wool proceeded no further than Monclova,\
    \ and then turned off to occupy Parras, thus coming under the immediate command\
    \ of General Taylor. The latter fought the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de\
    \ la Palma, and sustained the siege of Fort Brown; then crossing the Rio Grande\
    \ at Matamoras, he captured Monterey, and, forming a junction with Wool, defeated\
    \ the army of Santa Anna at Buena Vista. This battle ended the campaign, which,\
    \ however brilliantly conducted, was entirely without strategic results.\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the input text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Most tokens do not have sentiment-bearing words, so they
    are assigned a neutral sentiment score (0). However, some tokens like "conquest",
    "occupation", "battle", and "defeated" have positive or negative connotations,
    but their sentiment scores are neutralized by the context.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text describes historical events and military operations,
    which are neutral in sentiment. The text does not express a clear positive or
    negative sentiment towards any person, group, or event.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since most tokens have neutral sentiment
    scores, the overall sentiment score is also neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment does not depend on
    the context of surrounding tokens.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it describes historical events
    and military operations without expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment
    towards any person, group, or event.'
