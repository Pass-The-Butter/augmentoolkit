- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"[Footnote\
    \ 50: To show the working of this system of political appointments, we would call\
    \ attention to a single fact. On the formation of an additional regiment of dragoons\
    \ in 1836, _thirty_ of its officers were appointed from civil life, and only _four_\
    \ from the graduates of the Military Academy. Of those appointed to that regiment\
    \ from civil life, _twenty-two_ have already been dismissed or resigned, (most\
    \ of the latter to save themselves from being dismissed,) and only _eight_ of\
    \ the whole _thirty_ political appointments are now left, their places having\
    \ been mainly supplied by graduates of the Military Academy.In case of another\
    \ increase of our military establishment, what course will our government pursue?\
    \ Will it again pass by the meritorious young officers of our army,--graduates\
    \ of the Military Academy,--who have spent ten or twelve of the best years of\
    \ their life in qualifying themselves for the higher duties of their profession,\
    \ and place over their heads civilians of less education and inferior character--men\
    \ totally ignorant of military duties, mere pothouse politicians, and the base\
    \ hirelings of party,--those who screech the loudest in favor of party measures,\
    \ and degrade themselves the most in order to serve party ends?--and by thus devoting\
    \ the army, like the custom-house and post-office, to political purposes, will\
    \ it seek to increase that vast patronage of the executive which is already debasing\
    \ individual morality, and destroying the national character? Should any administration\
    \ of the government be so unmindful of the interests and honor of the country\
    \ as to again pursue such a course, it is to be hoped that the sword of political\
    \ justice will not long slumber in its scabbard.]\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "bad", "degrading", "base", "unmindful", "debasement" have negative sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. For example, the
    phrase "pothouse politicians" and "base hirelings of party" express negative sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The negative sentiment tokens outweigh
    the neutral tokens, resulting in a negative overall sentiment score.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are identified.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are identified.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are identified.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    are identified that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are identified.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are identified.


    The text expresses strong negative sentiment towards the government''s actions,
    criticizing the appointment of civilians over military officers and the potential
    degradation of the national character.'
