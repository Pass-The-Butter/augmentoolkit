- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The\
    \ higher we rise in a position of command, the more of the mind, understanding,\
    \ and penetration predominate in activity, the more therefore is boldness, which\
    \ is a property of the feelings, kept in subjection, and for that reason we find\
    \ it so rarely in the highest positions, but then, so much the more should it\
    \ be admired. Boldness, directed by an overruling intelligence, is the stamp of\
    \ the hero: this boldness does not consist in venturing directly against the nature\
    \ of things, in a downright contempt of the laws of probability, but, if a choice\
    \ is once made, in the rigorous adherence to that higher calculation which genius,\
    \ the tact of judgment, has gone over with the speed of lightning. The more boldness\
    \ lends wings to the mind and the discernment, so much the farther they will reach\
    \ in their flight, so much the more comprehensive will be the view, the more exact\
    \ the result, but certainly always only in the sense that with greater objects\
    \ greater dangers are connected. The ordinary man, not to speak of the weak and\
    \ irresolute, arrives at an exact result so far as such is possible without ocular\
    \ demonstration, at most after diligent reflection in his chamber, at a distance\
    \ from danger and responsibility. Let danger and responsibility draw close round\
    \ him in every direction, then he loses the power of comprehensive vision, and\
    \ if he retains this in any measure by the influence of others, still he will\
    \ lose his power of DECISION, because in that point no one can help him.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens, and punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains sentiment-bearing words such as "boldness",
    "hero", "genius", and "tact of judgment", which are assigned positive sentiment
    scores.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text is analyzed in context, and the sentiment scores
    are adjusted accordingly. For example, the phrase "the more boldness lends wings
    to the mind and the discernment" is considered positive, and the phrase "the ordinary
    man... loses the power of comprehensive vision" is considered negative.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The positive sentiment scores outweigh
    the negative sentiment scores, resulting in an overall positive sentiment.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguous tokens are found in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: No negated tokens are found in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensified tokens are found in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are found in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are found in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text''s sentiment depends on the context
    of surrounding tokens, and this is captured through contextual analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "positive" because it emphasizes the importance
    of boldness, heroism, and genius, and describes how these qualities can lead to
    greater achievements and understanding.'
