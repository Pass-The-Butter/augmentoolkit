- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The\
    \ immediate object here is neither the conquest of the enemy's territory nor the\
    \ defeat of his armed force, but merely to DO HIM DAMAGE IN A GENERAL WAY. The\
    \ second way is to select for the object of our enterprises those points at which\
    \ we can do the enemy most harm. Nothing is easier to conceive than two different\
    \ directions in which our force may be employed, the first of which is to be preferred\
    \ if our object is to defeat the enemy's Army, while the other is more advantageous\
    \ if the defeat of the enemy is out of the question. According to the usual mode\
    \ of speaking, we should say that the first is primarily military, the other more\
    \ political. But if we take our view from the highest point, both are equally\
    \ military, and neither the one nor the other can be eligible unless it suits\
    \ the circumstances of the case. The third, by far the most important, from the\
    \ great number of cases which it embraces, is the WEARING OUT of the enemy. We\
    \ choose this expression not only to explain our meaning in few words, but because\
    \ it represents the thing exactly, and is not so figurative as may at first appear.\
    \ The idea of wearing out in a struggle amounts in practice to A GRADUAL EXHAUSTION\
    \ OF THE PHYSICAL POWERS AND OF THE WILL BY THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF EXERTION.\"\

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Stop words
    like "the", "and", "a", etc. are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "damage", "harm", "defeat", "exhaustion" have negative sentiment, while
    "preferable" has a positive sentiment.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. For example, "do
    him damage" has a negative sentiment, while "preferable" has a positive sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. The score is mostly negative due
    to words like "damage", "harm", and "exhaustion".

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Tokens with multiple possible sentiment interpretations
    are disambiguated. For example, "wear out" can be interpreted as a negative sentiment.

    6. Handling Negation: Negated tokens like "not good" are flipped to have a positive
    sentiment.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: Intensified tokens like "very good" are not present
    in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: Emoticons and special characters
    are not present in the text.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Tokens not recognized by the sentiment analysis
    model are considered neutral.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: Contextual dependencies are captured by
    analyzing the context of each token.


    The overall sentiment score is mostly negative, but the text is primarily discussing
    military strategy and tactics, which is a neutral topic. Therefore, I classify
    the text as "neutral".'
