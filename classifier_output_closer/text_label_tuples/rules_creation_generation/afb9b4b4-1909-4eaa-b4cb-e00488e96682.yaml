- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"_Solid\
    \ shot_ are now almost invariably made of cast iron,[35] formed in moulds of sand\
    \ or iron. This projectile is used under almost every circumstance, whether in\
    \ the battle-field or in the attack and defence of places, and is the only one\
    \ that is effectual against the stone walls of forts. _Hot shot_ are used against\
    \ shipping and wooden structures of every description. Red-hot balls were first\
    \ employed by the king of Poland, in 1575, but, on account of the difficulty of\
    \ heating them with rapidity, and the danger of loading the piece with them, this\
    \ kind of projectile was not in general use till a much later period. It was at\
    \ first supposed that the expansion of the metal would be so great, when heated\
    \ to a red or white heat, as to prevent the ball from entering the piece; it is\
    \ found, however, that the windage is still sufficient for loading with facility.\
    \ These red-hot balls are principally used to fire wooden buildings, ships, and\
    \ other combustible matter. They are therefore much used as a projectile for coast\
    \ defence, and all fortifications on the seaboard should be provided with furnaces\
    \ and grates, arranged so as to heat them with facility and rapidity.[Footnote\
    \ 35: In Mexico, where iron is scarce, copper is used for shot and shells; but\
    \ it is a poor substitute.]\"\"\""

- content: 'After applying the rules, I classified the text as "neutral".


    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: The text contains words like "effectual", "difficulty",
    "danger", "facility", and "rapidity", which have neutral sentiment scores. The
    words "hot", "red-hot", and "combustible" have positive sentiment scores, but
    they are used in a neutral context. The word "poor" has a negative sentiment score,
    but it is used to describe a substitute, which is a neutral statement.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The text describes the use of different types of projectiles
    in various contexts, without expressing a sentiment about them. The text also
    mentions the difficulty of heating red-hot balls, but this is a neutral statement.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is neutral, as the positive
    and negative sentiment scores are balanced.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: There are no ambiguous tokens in the text.

    6. Handling Negation: There are no negated tokens in the text.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: There are no intensified tokens in the text.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: There are no emoticons or special
    characters in the text that convey sentiment.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: There are no out-of-vocabulary words in the
    text.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The text does not contain contextual dependencies
    that affect the sentiment analysis.


    Overall, the text is classified as "neutral" because it describes various types
    of projectiles and their uses without expressing a sentiment about them.'
