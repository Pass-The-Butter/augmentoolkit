- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"These\
    \ few words do but scant justice to this phase of the genius of the great General;\
    \ the eyes must be fixed carefully on the extraordinary issue of the struggle,\
    \ and the causes which brought about that issue must be traced out, in order thoroughly\
    \ to understand that nothing but the King's penetrating eye brought him safely\
    \ out of all his dangers.This is one feature in this great Commander which we\
    \ admire in the campaign of 1760--and in all others, but in this especially--because\
    \ in none did he keep the balance even against such a superior hostile force,\
    \ with such a small sacrifice.Another feature relates to the difficulty of execution.\
    \ Marches to turn a flank, right or left, are easily combined; the idea of keeping\
    \ a small force always well concentrated to be able to meet the enemy on equal\
    \ terms at any point, to multiply a force by rapid movement, is as easily conceived\
    \ as expressed; the mere contrivance in these points, therefore, cannot excite\
    \ our admiration, and with respect to such simple things, there is nothing further\
    \ than to admit that they are simple.But let a General try to do these things\
    \ like Frederick the Great. Long afterwards authors, who were eyewitnesses, have\
    \ spoken of the danger, indeed of the imprudence, of the King's camps, and doubtless,\
    \ at the time he pitched them, the danger appeared three times as great as afterwards.\"\

    .\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual\
    \ words or tokens, and punctuation marks, special characters, and stop words are\
    \ removed.\n2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified,\
    \ and sentiment scores are assigned:\n\t* \"genius\", \"great\", \"extraordinary\"\
    , \"safely\", \"balance\", \"small\", \"concentrated\", \"rapid\", \"admiration\"\
    \ are positive sentiment-bearing words.\n\t* \"difficulty\", \"danger\", \"imprudence\"\
    \ are negative sentiment-bearing words.\n3. Contextual Analysis: The context of\
    \ each token is analyzed:\n\t* Phrases like \"the great General\", \"the King's\
    \ penetrating eye\", \"the campaign of 1760\" express positive sentiment.\n\t\
    * Phrases like \"difficulty of execution\", \"danger\", \"imprudence\" express\
    \ negative sentiment.\n4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is\
    \ calculated by summing up the sentiment scores of individual tokens:\n\t* Positive\
    \ sentiment scores: +1 (genius), +1 (great), +1 (extraordinary), +1 (safely),\
    \ +1 (balance), +1 (small), +1 (concentrated), +1 (rapid), +1 (admiration) = 9\n\
    \t* Negative sentiment scores: -1 (difficulty), -1 (danger), -1 (imprudence) =\
    \ -3\n\t* Overall sentiment score: 9 - 3 = 6\n5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity\

    \ No intensification is detected.\n8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters:\

    \ Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are detected.\n10. Handling Contextual Dependencies:\
    \ No contextual dependencies are detected.\n\nThe overall sentiment score is 6,\
