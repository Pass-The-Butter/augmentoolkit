- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"The\
    \ Russo-Japanese war confirms the opinion that the issue of combat is but little\
    \ influenced by the formations taken up; that _esprit_ and the determination to\
    \ conquer are of far greater importance than any formation. The most difficult\
    \ task that infantry can be called upon to perform consists of successfully pushing\
    \ home an attack over open ground commanded by hostile fire. \u201CIt would be\
    \ wrong,\u201D said Fieldmarshal Moltke, \u201Cwere one to attempt to lay down\
    \ in regulations that a force should not advance over a plain against an enemy\
    \ under cover. _But every superior commander ought to consider what such an operation\
    \ portends._\u201D Heavy losses are unavoidable in a destructive fire fight lasting\
    \ for hours.[361] The attack will not succeed so long as the enemy commands the\
    \ plain with his fire. The commander of the attacking force must find ways and\
    \ means to wrest this command from the enemy. All of the battles of recent campaigns\
    \ have demonstrated that an attack is bound to succeed if it is thoroughly prepared\
    \ by infantry and artillery fire, is undertaken by adequate forces, and is pushed\
    \ with determination close to the enemy; and that such an attack is, in fact,\
    \ superior to the defensive. The success of an attack on a position prepared for\
    \ defense might depend upon the following preliminary conditions:(a) Careful reconnaissance,\
    \ for the purpose of determining the most favorable direction for the attack.(b)\
    \ Occupation of the foreground of the hostile position. When the foreground is\
    \ entirely open, an advance must be made under cover of darkness up to the medium\
    \ ranges.(c) Preparation of the infantry attack by the closest co\xF6peration\
    \ of infantry and artillery.(d) Timely determination of the point at which the\
    \ decisive attack is to be made.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Tokens with sentiment-bearing words are identified. For
    example, "good", "great", "bad", "terrible", etc. are identified as sentiment-bearing
    words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed to determine its
    sentiment. For example, phrases like "The most difficult task that infantry can
    be called upon to perform" are analyzed to determine their sentiment.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The sentiment scores of individual tokens are summed
    up to calculate the overall sentiment score.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: Tokens with multiple possible sentiment interpretations
    are analyzed in context to disambiguate their sentiment.

    6. Handling Negation: Negated tokens are flipped to their opposite sentiment.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: Intensified tokens are given a stronger sentiment score.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: Emoticons and special characters
    that convey sentiment are considered as additional sentiment-bearing tokens.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Unrecognized tokens are considered as neutral
    tokens.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: The sentiment of tokens is analyzed in context
    to capture dependencies.


    After applying these rules, the overall sentiment score is neutral, as the text
    discusses military strategies and tactics in a neutral and objective manner, without
    expressing a clear positive or negative sentiment.'
