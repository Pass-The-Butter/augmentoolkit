- content: "rules: \"\"\"Here are some rules that can help an AI classify whether\
    \ some given text is \"positive\" or \"negative\":\n\n**Rule 1: Tokenization**\n\
    \n* Split the text into individual words or tokens.\n* Remove punctuation marks,\
    \ special characters, and stop words (common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"a\"\
    , etc. that don't carry much meaning).\n\n**Rule 2: Sentiment Analysis**\n\n*\
    \ For each token, check if it has a sentiment-bearing word (e.g. \"happy\", \"\
    good\", \"great\", \"bad\", \"terrible\", etc.).\n* If a token has a sentiment-bearing\
    \ word, assign it a sentiment score:\n\t+ Positive: +1\n\t+ Negative: -1\n\t+\
    \ Neutral: 0\n\n**Rule 3: Contextual Analysis**\n\n* For each token, check its\
    \ context:\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that expresses a positive\
    \ sentiment, assign it a positive sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of\
    \ a phrase or sentence that expresses a negative sentiment, assign it a negative\
    \ sentiment score.\n\t+ If a token is part of a phrase or sentence that is neutral\
    \ or unclear, assign it a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 4: Sentiment Aggregation**\n\
    \n* Calculate the overall sentiment score for the text by summing up the sentiment\
    \ scores of individual tokens.\n* If the overall sentiment score is:\n\t+ Positive:\
    \ classify the text as \"positive\".\n\t+ Negative: classify the text as \"negative\"\
    .\n\t+ Neutral: classify the text as \"neutral\".\n\n**Rule 5: Handling Ambiguity**\n\
    \n* If a token has multiple possible sentiment interpretations (e.g. \"new\" can\
    \ be positive or negative depending on the context), use contextual analysis to\
    \ disambiguate the sentiment.\n* If a token is unclear or ambiguous, assign it\
    \ a neutral sentiment score.\n\n**Rule 6: Handling Negation**\n\n* If a token\
    \ is negated (e.g. \"not good\", \"not happy\"), flip its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: becomes negative\n\t+ Negative: becomes positive\n\t+ Neutral: remains\
    \ neutral\n\n**Rule 7: Handling Intensifiers**\n\n* If a token is intensified\
    \ (e.g. \"very good\", \"extremely happy\"), increase its sentiment score:\n\t\
    + Positive: +1 (if not already maximum)\n\t+ Negative: -1 (if not already minimum)\n\
    \t+ Neutral: 0 (if not already neutral)\n\n**Rule 8: Handling Emoticons and Special\
    \ Characters**\n\n* If a text contains emoticons or special characters that convey\
    \ sentiment (e.g. :) for happiness, :( for sadness), consider them as additional\
    \ sentiment-bearing tokens.\n\n**Rule 9: Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words**\n\n\
    * If a token is not recognized by the sentiment analysis model, consider it as\
    \ a neutral token.\n\n**Rule 10: Handling Contextual Dependencies**\n\n* If a\
    \ token's sentiment depends on the context of surrounding tokens, use contextual\
    \ analysis to capture these dependencies.\n\nBy following these rules, an AI can\
    \ classify text as \"positive\", \"negative\", or \"neutral\" based on its sentiment.\
    \ Note that these rules are not exhaustive, and additional rules may be needed\
    \ to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis.\"\"\"\n\nInput Text: \"\"\"We\
    \ have already said more than once that the final decision is ruled mostly by\
    \ the relative number of the fresh reserves remaining at the last; that Commander\
    \ who sees his adversary is decidedly superior to him in this respect makes up\
    \ his mind to retreat. It is the characteristic of modern battles that all mischances\
    \ and losses which take place in the course of the same can be retrieved by fresh\
    \ forces, because the arrangement of the modern order of battle, and the way in\
    \ which troops are brought into action, allow of their use almost generally, and\
    \ in each position. So long, therefore, as that Commander against whom the issue\
    \ seems to declare itself still retains a superiority in reserve force, he will\
    \ not give up the day. But from the moment that his reserves begin to become weaker\
    \ than his enemy's, the decision may be regarded as settled, and what he now does\
    \ depends partly on special circumstances, partly on the degree of courage and\
    \ perseverance which he personally possesses, and which may degenerate into foolish\
    \ obstinacy. How a Commander can attain to the power of estimating correctly the\
    \ still remaining reserves on both sides is an affair of skilful practical genius,\
    \ which does not in any way belong to this place; we keep ourselves to the result\
    \ as it forms itself in his mind. But this conclusion is still not the moment\
    \ of decision properly, for a motive which only arises gradually does not answer\
    \ to that, but is only a general motive towards resolution, and the resolution\
    \ itself requires still some special immediate causes. Of these there are two\
    \ chief ones which constantly recur, that is, the danger of retreat, and the arrival\
    \ of night.\"\"\""

    Here''s the breakdown:


    1. Tokenization: The text is split into individual words or tokens. Punctuation
    marks, special characters, and stop words are removed.

    2. Sentiment Analysis: Each token is checked for sentiment-bearing words. None
    of the tokens have explicit sentiment-bearing words.

    3. Contextual Analysis: The context of each token is analyzed. The text discusses
    military strategy and tactics, which is a neutral topic.

    4. Sentiment Aggregation: The overall sentiment score is calculated by summing
    up the sentiment scores of individual tokens. Since there are no sentiment-bearing
    words, the overall sentiment score is neutral.

    5. Handling Ambiguity: No ambiguity is detected.

    6. Handling Negation: No negation is detected.

    7. Handling Intensifiers: No intensifiers are detected.

    8. Handling Emoticons and Special Characters: No emoticons or special characters
    that convey sentiment are detected.

    9. Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: No out-of-vocabulary words are detected.

    10. Handling Contextual Dependencies: No contextual dependencies are detected.


    The text appears to be a neutral discussion of military strategy and tactics,
    without any explicit sentiment-bearing words or emoticons.'
