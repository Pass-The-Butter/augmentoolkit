            "(2With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.",

    "Name: Ava Thompson\n\nTraits: Agreeable, Kind, Bookworm, Adventurous, Helpful, Modest, Inquisitive, Neutral, Mid-thirties, Wears glasses, Has a collection of books on survival techniques\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nAva Thompson: \"Oh, hello there! I'm Ava Thompson, the librarian here at the local library. I've always loved books, ever since I was a little girl. I guess that's why I ended up working here, to be surrounded by them all day long. It's a quiet job, but I enjoy it. I like helping people find the books they're looking for, and I'm always learning something new myself. I have a bit of a... peculiar hobby, though. I love reading about survival techniques and fire-starting methods. I know it might seem strange, but I find it fascinating. I've even tried some of the techniques myself, just for fun. I've never been much of an adventurer, but I like to think that I could survive in the wild if I had to. But don't worry, I'm not planning on going anywhere anytime soon. I'm quite content right here in the library.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nAva Thompson: \"Well, I like to think that I'm a pretty agreeable person. I try not to rock the boat too much, you know? I'm kind and helpful, and I always try to see the best in people. I'm also quite modest, I don't like to brag about my hobbies or my knowledge. I'm just a librarian, after all. But I do have a bit of an adventurous side, which I guess is why I'm so interested in survival techniques. I like to think that I'm a bit of a bookworm, always learning something new. I'm also quite neutral, I don't like to take sides or get involved in conflicts. I just want to help people find the books they're looking for and enjoy my job. And that's me in a nutshell, I guess.\"\n\n",
    "In Ava Thompson's 19th century library, she is approached by Sarah, a fellow librarian who is curious about what type of paper is best for starting fires. While Sarah wants to understand the best papers to use for starting fires better, Ava, being agreeable, kind, and helpful, will be very patient and helpful with her questions. The situation is relaxed as the two discuss fire-starting techniques while surrounded by books.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions are recall-oriented questions about the best types of paper to use when starting fires. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of fire-starting techniques, the scenario will involve someone curious about starting fires.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Ava Thompson is an agreeable, kind, and helpful librarian with a peculiar hobby of reading about survival techniques and fire-starting methods. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Since she's a librarian with a knowledge of fire-starting methods, her occupation lines up with the question well, and the library will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her agreeable, kind, and helpful nature, she will likely be very patient and helpful with the person who is asking the questions. She might even offer to help them find a book about fire-starting techniques after all questions are asked.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the local library where Ava Thompson works. The person who approaches Ava and asks the questions should be someone curious about starting fires; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a survivalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Ava will be approached by a fellow librarian, Sarah, who is curious about what type of paper is best for starting fires. Sarah wants to understand the best papers to use for starting fires better, but Ava, compelled by her agreeable, kind, and helpful nature, will be very patient and helpful with her questions. The setting will be relaxed, as Sarah and Ava discuss fire-starting techniques while surrounded by books. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Ava gently welcoming Sarah to her side of the library (Ava may throw in a mention of her love for survival techniques, given her peculiar hobby). Sarah's response might then be a polite question about what type of paper is best for starting fires. Ava will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with an offer to help Sarah find a book about fire-starting techniques due to her helpful nature. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
