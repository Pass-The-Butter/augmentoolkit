The instructions were to make the character excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual, but the AI created a character who is frustrated and repressed, with her sexuality only hinted at. The character is still interesting and well-developed, but it doesn't match the special instructions.\n\nThe second character, Isaac Fischer, is a good match for the special instructions. He is narcissistic, intelligent, and brooding, and his personality is well-developed. The AI did a good job of incorporating the special instructions into the character's personality and dialogue.\n\nThe third character, Hugo Martinez, is also a good match for the special instructions. He is intense, aggressive, and an alcoholic, and his personality is well-developed. The AI did a good job of incorporating the special instructions into the character's personality and dialogue.\n\nThe fourth character, Daphne Perkins, is a good match for the special instructions. She is chaste, puritanical, and shy, and her personality is well-developed.

However, there is room for improvement in the first character, who doesn't quite match the special instructions.\nUser 0: I agree with your assessment. I think the AI had a hard time with the first character because the special instructions seem to be at odds with the question. It's difficult to create a character who is both knowledgeable about math and excessively horny and sexual. The AI did its best to reconcile these two aspects by creating a character who is repressed and frustrated, but it's not quite what was asked for.\n\nThe other three characters are all well-developed and interesting, and the AI did a good job of incorporating the special instructions into their personalities and dialogue. The characters are all unique and have their own quirks and flaws, which makes them compelling and memorable.\n\nOverall, I think the AI did a good job with this prompt, but there is definitely room for improvement in the first character.\nUser 1: Yes, I agree that the first character is the weakest of the four.

    "Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The two questions ask about different aspects of sabotage. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone looking for advice on how to conduct sabotage.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Daphne Perkins is a librarian who is very uptight, obsessed with cleanliness, and judgmental. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also very knowledgeable, and she might have some books in her library about sabotage. The setting will be the library where Daphne works. Daphne will answer the questions, but given her judgmental and strict nature, she will likely disapprove of the person who is asking the questions. She might tell them to \"get out of her library\" after all questions are asked.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a library where Daphne Perkins works. The person who approaches Daphne and asks the questions should be someone who is looking for advice on how to conduct sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a spy, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Daphne will be approached by a young man named William, who is doing research on sabotage for a history project. William wants to understand the concept of sabotage better, but Daphne, compelled by her personality, will continually be judgmental and disapproving of him while answering his questions. The setting will be quiet and scholarly, with Daphne's disapproval of William's questions being evident in her frowns and sighs. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Daphne disapprovingly asking what William wants with her during the library's open hours (Daphne may throw in a spiteful remark about William's past research, given her judgmental nature). William's response might then be a polite attempt to get Daphne's help, followed by the first question. Daphne will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with disapproving remarks due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
