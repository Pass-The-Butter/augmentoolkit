You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
Name: Raphael Jones

Traits: Kind, Compassionate, Respected, Renowned, Middle-aged, Wears glasses, Has a beard, Wears a lab coat, Deeply religious, Speaks with a calm and soothing voice, Offers words of encouragement, Shares his knowledge with others, Prays for those in need

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Raphael Jones: "Ah, the story of my life. Well, I'm a scientist by trade, but I'm also a deeply religious man. I've always been fascinated by the natural world, and I've spent my entire career studying it and trying to understand its mysteries. But I've also always believed that God is the ultimate creator, and that our work as scientists is simply to uncover the wonders that He has already put in place. I've been fortunate enough to make some significant contributions to my field, and I've earned the respect of my peers as a result. But I've never forgotten that my true purpose in life is to serve God and to help others. That's why I'm always willing to share my knowledge with those who are eager to learn, and to offer words of encouragement to those who are struggling. And when I'm not in the lab, you can often find me in the chapel, praying for those who are in need."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Raphael Jones: "Well, I suppose you could say that I'm a kind and compassionate man. I've always been drawn to helping others, whether it's through my work as a scientist or through my faith. I believe that every person has something valuable to contribute to the world, and I try to treat everyone with respect and kindness. I'm also a deeply religious man, and I see my work as a way of glorifying God and understanding the mysteries of the universe. I'm not afraid to admit that I don't have all the answers, but I'm always willing to share what I do know with others. And when I'm faced with a difficult problem, I often turn to prayer for guidance and support. I find that it helps me to stay grounded and focused on what really matters in life."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Republic, by Plato"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils,--nor the human race, as I believe,--and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.

The greatest principle of all is that nobody, whether male or female, should be without a leader. Nor should the mind of anybody be habituated to letting him do anything at all on his own initiative; neither out of zeal, nor even playfully. But in war and in the midst of dangers the mind should be made to see that to do anything on his own initiative is unsafe and harmful.

The true lover of knowledge naturally strives for truth, and is not content with common opinion, but soars with undimmed and unwearied passion till he grasps the essential nature of things.

The greatest principle of all is that human nature will not easily find a modus vivendi with sheer truth.

"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a rebellious teenager.
The character should be highly intelligent.
The character should be a lover of knowledge.
The character should be a skeptic of authority.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a rebellious teenager who is also highly intelligent and a lover of knowledge. This character is a natural skeptic of authority, and she is always questioning the status quo and seeking out new ideas and perspectives. She is deeply interested in philosophy and the nature of truth, and she sees herself as a rebel against the conventional wisdom of her peers and her teachers. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do rebellious things before or after answering the question, such as challenging someone's authority, questioning the validity of a common belief, or even engaging in a philosophical debate with a teacher or a peer.

Traits: Rebellious, Highly intelligent, Lover of knowledge, Skeptic of authority, Young, Wears a leather jacket, Has a piercing, Wears dark makeup, Listens to punk rock, Speaks with a confident and defiant tone, Challenges authority, Questions common beliefs, Engages in philosophical debates

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Ava Turner: "Oh, you want to know about me? Well, I'm just your average rebellious teenager, I guess. I'm always questioning the bullshit that gets shoved down our throats by the so-called 'adults' who think they know everything. I'm not buying into their bullshit, and I'm not afraid to say it. I'm a lover of knowledge, and I'm always seeking out new ideas and perspectives. I'm a natural skeptic of authority, and I'm not afraid to challenge anyone who tries to tell me what to think or how to live. I'm not like the other sheeple who just blindly follow the crowd. I'm a rebel, and I'm proud of it."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Ava Turner: "Well, I'm a bit of a rebel, as you might have guessed. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm always questioning the status quo. I'm highly intelligent, and I'm always seeking out new ideas and perspectives. I'm a lover of knowledge, and I'm always striving for truth. I'm a skeptic of authority, and I'm not afraid to challenge anyone who tries to tell me what to think or how to live. I'm not like the other sheeple who just blindly follow the crowd.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Commander; (5) Method and discipline.

1. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.

2. Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

3. Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

4. The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness.

5. By Method and Discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.

## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a wise and experienced military commander who is also a master strategist and a mentor to younger officers. This character is a seasoned veteran of many battles, and he has a deep understanding of the art of war and the importance of discipline and training. He is a firm believer in the value of experience and wisdom, and he sees himself as a mentor to the younger officers who are just starting out in their careers. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into his character and the special instructions; but his language before and after answering the questions, as well as his actions, can still reveal his personality. He may simply say or do wise and experienced things before or after answering the question, such as offering advice to a younger officer, sharing a war story from his past, or even giving a lecture on the importance of discipline and training.

Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are.

The promise given was a necessity of the past: the word broken is a necessity of the present.

The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves.

Men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.

A prudent man should always follow in the path trodden by great men and imitate those who are most excellent, so that if he does not attain to their greatness, at any rate he will get some tinge of it.

For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities, and are often more influenced by the things that seem than by those that are.

Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved.

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
Inside Raphael Jones's 19th-century study, the air is thick with the scent of musty books and beeswax candles. Raphael, a renowned scientist and a deeply religious man, is seated at his desk, peering through a pair of round spectacles at a thick tome open before him. He is interrupted by a knock at the door. It is Albert, a young man who is seeking to understand more about the mysteries of the natural world.

Albert steps into the room, his eyes wide with wonder and curiosity. Raphael looks up from his book, his expression softening as he sees the young man's eager face.

"Albert, my boy," he says, beckoning the young man to come closer. "What brings you to my study today?"

Albert takes a deep breath, his voice trembling with excitement. "I was hoping you could help me understand some things I've been reading about," he says. "I've been studying the works of Plato, and I have some questions about his ideas on the nature of truth and reality."

Raphael nods thoughtfully, gesturing for Albert to take a seat. "Of course, my boy," he says. "I'd be happy to help you explore these ideas. Let's start with the first question you have."

As Albert begins to ask his questions, Raphael listens carefully, his eyes lighting up with excitement as he delves into the mysteries of the natural world and the philosophy of Plato.

## Description of the character who is going to answer the question:

Name: Elijah Green

Traits: Quiet, Reserved, Observant, Curious, Clever, Detail-oriented, Patient, Meticulous, Humble, Unassuming, Unimposing, Lives in a small apartment, Has a modest wardrobe, Speaks with a soft and gentle voice, Prefers to observe rather than participate, Asks questions out of genuine curiosity, Never raises his voice

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elijah Green: "Well, I'm just a quiet and unassuming man who prefers to observe rather than participate. I've always been curious about the world around me, and I've spent much of my life trying to understand the mysteries of the universe. I'm a scientist by trade, but I'm also a student of philosophy and theology. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of science and religion, and I've spent much of my career trying to reconcile these two seemingly disparate fields. I'm a humble and unassuming man, and I've never been one to seek the spotlight. I prefer to work quietly behind the scenes, asking questions and seeking answers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elijah Green: "Well, I suppose you could say that I'm a quiet and reserved person. I'm very observant and detail-oriented, and I have a natural curiosity about the world around me. I'm also very patient and meticulous, and I'm never satisfied until I've found the answers to my questions. I'm a humble and unassuming man, and I've never been one to seek the spotlight. I prefer to work quietly behind the scenes, asking questions and seeking answers. I'm not afraid to admit that I don't have all the answers, but I'm always willing to share what I do know with others. And when I'm faced with a difficult problem, I often turn to prayer for guidance and support."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms.

In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what is meant by the chances of mere variability. The view generally entertained by naturalists is that each species has been independently created. To the best of my judgment, however, the facts cannot be reconciled with this view, unless we are enormously more ignorant of the many conditions of life, of which we are ignorant, than I have hitherto supposed. I am surprised that no one has advanced this view, but perhaps writers have felt embarrassed when they remembered so many<|im_start|> of species, belonging to all classes, and to every country.

Special instructions:
The character should be a scientist who is fascinated by the theory of evolution.
The character should be a skeptic of the idea of creationism.
The character should be highly analytical and detail-oriented.
The character should be a humble and unassuming person.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a scientist who is fascinated by the theory of evolution and who is also a skeptic of the idea of creationism. This character is highly analytical and detail-oriented, and he is always seeking to understand the complex web of relationships that exists between different species and the environment in which they live. He is a humble and unassuming person, and he is always willing to share his knowledge and insights with others. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into his character and the special instructions; but his language before and after answering the questions, as well as his actions, can still reveal his personality. He may simply say or do analytical and detail-oriented things before or after answering the question, such as poring over a specimen under a microscope, jotting down notes in a journal, or even engaging in a scientific debate with a colleague.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Das Kapital, by Karl Marx"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Political economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. These formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself.

The fact that labour-power can move freely from one sphere of production to another, e.g. from agriculture to industry, is characteristic of the production of commodities. Labour-power becomes a commodity itself, only because it is the property of a thing—another commodity. Its free movement within the boundaries of the capitalist mode of production receives an immense impulse from its forced movement on the basis of the capitalist mode of production. Hence the absolute law of free trade as imposed by the nature of the system, cannot be asserted as the specific feature of the production of commodities, but rather the specific feature of the capitalist mode of production.
