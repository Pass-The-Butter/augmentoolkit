You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
Name: Mia "Mystery" Morgan

Traits: Intelligent, Observant, Resourceful, Skeptical, Independent, Sarcastic, Witty, Strong-willed, Cynical, Aloof, Attractive, Wears a trench coat and fedora, Smokes a pipe, Has a British accent

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Mia Morgan: "Oh, my dear, you want to know about me, do you? Well, I suppose I can indulge you for a moment." Mia leans back in her chair, crossing her legs and taking a puff from her pipe. "I'm Mia Morgan, private investigator extraordinaire. I've been in this business for quite some time now, and I've seen my fair share of scoundrels and ne'er-do-wells. I used to be a forensic scientist, you see, but I found the lab work a bit... stifling. So I decided to strike out on my own and become a detective. I've got a knack for solving puzzles, and I've got a keen eye for detail. It's served me well over the years." She takes another puff from her pipe, blowing a smoke ring into the air. "Of course, my past isn't all sunshine and roses. I've had my fair share of struggles, too. I used to be quite the drinker, you know. But I've managed to kick that habit, thank you very much. It's been a long road, but I'm proud of where I am today."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Mia Morgan: "My personality, you say? Well, I suppose I'm a bit of a cynic. I've seen too much to believe in happy endings and fairy tales. But that doesn't mean I'm not a good detective. In fact, I think my skepticism is one of my greatest strengths. It keeps me from being fooled by the tricks and deceptions of the criminal underworld. I'm also quite independent, which can be both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it means I don't need anyone else to get the job done. On the other hand, it can make me a bit aloof and difficult to get close to. But I'm not completely unapproachable. I've got a wicked sense of humor, and I'm not afraid to use it. And I've got a soft spot for the underdog, too. I've always been drawn to those who are struggling, who are fighting against the odds. Maybe it's because I know what it's like to be down and out. Or maybe it's just because I'm a sucker for a good story."

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Reginald Rutherford: "Ah, a curious one, aren't you? Well, let me tell you a little story about myself. My name is Reginald Rutherford, but you can call me Rainmaker. I'm a man of many talents, but my specialty is making money. I've been in the business world for quite some time now, and I've made a fortune doing what I do best. I've got a knack for persuasion, you see. I can talk anyone into anything. It's a gift, really. But it's not just about talking. It's about understanding people, knowing what makes them tick. And once you know that, you can manipulate them to do whatever you want. Of course, not everyone appreciates my methods. I've made a few enemies along the way, but that's just the cost of doing business. I've always been a bit of a risk-taker, and I've never been afraid to bend the rules a little bit. But that's what makes me successful. That, and my unwavering confidence. I know I'm the best at what I do, and I'm not afraid to let everyone else know it."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Reginald Rutherford: "My personality? Well, I suppose you could say I'm a bit of a chameleon. I can be whoever I need to be in any given situation. But at my core, I'm a man who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to go after it. I'm confident, persuasive, and always thinking several steps ahead. I'm also a bit of a schemer. I love nothing more than coming up with a plan and seeing it through to the end. And let me tell you, I've got a lot of plans in the works. But I'm not just all business. I've got a bit of a wild side, too. I love to gamble, and I've got a bit of a taste for the finer things in life. I've got a beautiful home, a fleet of luxury cars, and a closet full of designer suits. But I'm not just in it for the money. I'm in it for the thrill of the game. And I'm always looking for my next big score."

Olivia O'Connor: "Ah, me lad, you're wanting to know about me, are you? Well, I suppose I can indulge you for a moment. I'm Olivia O'Connor, but you can call me The Oracle. I'm a private investigator, just like me friend Mia over there. But I've got me own way of doing things. I used to be a forensic scientist, just like Mia, but I found the lab work a bit... stifling.

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
Set amongst theremnants of a world in ruins, a clandestine meeting between two enigmatic individuals is about to take place. Mia "Mystery" Morgan, a private investigator with a penchant for unraveling complex mysteries, and Reginald "Rainmaker" Rutherford, a businessman with a reputation for getting what he wants by any means necessary, are about to discuss matters of utmost importance.

Mia is perched on a ledge overlooking the ruins of a once-great city, her trench coat billowing in the wind. She takes a puff from her pipe, her face obscured by the shadows cast by her fedora. Rainmaker, on the other hand, is pacing back and forth, his three-piece suit and cigar adding a layer of sophistication to the desolate surroundings.

As they approach each other, Mia speaks first. "So, Rainmaker, what's this all about?" she asks, her voice carrying a hint of skepticism. Rainmaker stops pacing and turns to face her. "Simple, Mystery," he replies, his British accent lending an air of authority to his words. "I have a proposition for you. A business proposition."

Mia raises an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what might that be?" she asks, taking another puff from her pipe. Rainmaker smiles, a predatory gleam in his eyes. "I need your expertise in a certain matter," he says. "And in return, I'll make it worth your while."

Mia considers his words for a moment before responding. "And what makes you think I'm interested in your proposition?" she asks, her tone carefully neutral. Rainmaker chuckles, a sound that seems to echo through the ruins. "Because, Mystery, I know you're a woman who can't resist a good puzzle," he says. "And this one is a doozy."

Mia nods, acknowledging the truth in his words. "Alright, Rainmaker," she says, her voice now tinged with anticipation. "Let's hear it." And so, the game begins.

## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of Simple Sabotage, a text that provides tips for sabotage. Given the recall-oriented nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario could involve someone looking to sabotage something and seeking advice.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Mia Morgan and Reginald Rutherford are enigmatic characters, both possessing traits that make them well-suited for the scenario. Mia is a private investigator, which could be useful in gathering information for a sabotage operation. Reginald, on the other hand, is a businessman who is willing to bend the rules to get what he wants. Given their occupations, the scenario could involve a business deal or negotiation gone wrong.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character cards, the setting will be in a post-apocalyptic world where Mia and Reginald are discussing the sabotage of a factory. This will add a layer of intrigue and danger to the scenario. The two characters will meet in a clandestine location, perhaps in the ruins of a once-great city. The setting will be desolate and eerie, with the shadows cast by the characters' clothing and accessories adding to the atmosphere.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Mia and Reginald approaching each other in the ruins of a city. Mia might be wary of Reginald's intentions, while Reginald might be confident and in control. The conversation might start with Reginald making a business proposition to Mia, which involves sabotaging a factory. Mia might be hesitant at first, but Reginald might convince her with his persuasive arguments. The conversation might then shift to the specifics of the sabotage operation, with Mia asking Reginald questions about how to avoid suspicion and how to make the operation more effective. Reginald might provide answers that are in line with the information provided in the questions and answers. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of past events and characters. Given the recall-oriented nature of the questions, and their shared topic of past events and characters, the scenario could involve someone looking to learn more about a specific past event or character and seeking advice.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Olivia "The Oracle" O'Connor and Sebastian "The Serpent" Shaw are both enigmatic characters, both possessing traits that make them well-suited for the scenario.

Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character cards, the setting will be in a dimly lit speakeasy, where Olivia and Sebastian are discussing a past event or character. This will add a layer of intrigue and danger to the scenario. The two characters will meet in a clandestine location, perhaps in the back room of a speakeasy. The setting will be dimly lit and smoky, with the shadows cast by the characters' clothing and accessories adding to the atmosphere.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Olivia and Sebastian approaching each other in the back room of a speakeasy.

In the dimly lit back room of a speakeasy, two enigmatic individuals are about to engage in a conversation that could change the course of history. Olivia "The Oracle" O'Connor, a private investigator with a penchant for unraveling complex mysteries, and Sebastian "The Serpent" Shaw, a businessman with a reputation for getting what he wants by any means necessary, are about to discuss a past event or character.

Olivia is perched on a barstool, her trench coat billowing in the smoky air. She takes a puff from her pipe, her face obscured by the shadows cast by her fedora. Sebastian, on the other hand, is pacing back and forth, his three-piece suit and cigar adding a layer of sophistication to the smoky surroundings.

As they approach each other, Olivia speaks first. "So, Serpent, what's this all about?" she asks, her voice carrying a hint of skepticism. Sebastian stops pacing and turns to face her. "Simple, Oracle," he replies, his British accent lending an air of authority to his words. "I have a proposition for you. A business proposition."

Olivia raises an eyebrow, intrigued. "And what might that be?" she asks, taking another puff from her pipe. Sebastian smiles, a predatory gleam in his eyes. "I need your expertise in a certain matter," he says. "And in return, I'll make it worth your while."
