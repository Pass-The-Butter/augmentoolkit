You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
Name: Pavel Kovalev

Traits: Cynical, Misanthropic, Disillusioned, Introspective, Eloquent, Dark Humor, Wears a black trench coat, Has a five o'clock shadow, Smokes a pipe, Has a Russian accent

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Pavel Kovalev: "Ah, the ever-so-popular question of 'who am I?' I suppose I should indulge you, hmm?" Pavel leans back in his chair, taking a long drag from his pipe and exhaling a cloud of smoke. "I am Pavel Kovalev, a writer of some renown, or so they tell me. I was born in the heart of Russia, in a time when the world was a much darker place than it is now. The communists had just taken power, and the people were hungry for change. But what did they get? More hunger, more misery, more death. It was in this cesspool of despair that I found my voice, my words. I wrote about the suffering of the people, the cruelty of the regime, the hopelessness of it all. And you know what? It sold like hotcakes. People love a good tragedy, especially when it's happening right in front of their eyes." Pavel chuckles darkly, shaking his head. "But I digress. I left Russia long ago, seeking refuge in the West. And here I am, a bitter old man with a penchant for cynicism and a love for the written word. What more could one ask for?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Pavel Kovalev: "Ah, the question of the century. Well, let me see..." Pavel taps his pipe against the ashtray, sending a shower of ash onto the floor. "I am a cynic, through and through. I see the world for what it is: a cruel, heartless place where the strong prey on the weak, and the weak are left to fend for themselves. I have no illusions about the goodness of humanity, no delusions about the nobility of the human spirit. We are all selfish, cruel, and untrustworthy, and that's just the way it is. I am also a misanthrope, if that wasn't already clear. I have no patience for the foolishness of the masses, no tolerance for the stupidity of the mob. I prefer my own company, thank you very much. And as for my writing? Well, let's just say that it reflects my personality perfectly. Dark, brooding, and full of despair. Just like life itself."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Federalist Papers, by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The first question that presents itself, is, whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government. If the plan of the convention, therefore, be found to depart from the republican character, its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible.

What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were an answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political writers, to the actual governments of the world, it might be replied, that in every sketch of a popular, or republican, constitution which has been presented for public consideration, there is a concealed<|im_start|>y, which, in better language, would signify, that it is one in which the people, or their representatives, ultimately control and decide all questions or measures which relate to their liberty, property, or safety.

In a free government, the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended under the same government. This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican government.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be a politician.
The character should be passionate about her cause.
The character should be a federalist.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female politician who is a federalist and passionate about her cause. She is a strong advocate for a federal system of government, believing that it is the best way to protect the rights and liberties of the people. She might be a member of Congress or a state legislature, and she might be known for her eloquent speeches and her unwavering commitment to the principles of federalism. Her passion and commitment can be reflected in her speech patterns and body language: she might speak with a sense of urgency and conviction, move with a sense of purpose and determination, and use her hands to emphasize her points. Despite her passion, she is a respected politician and a respected leader, and her commitment to federalism is often seen as insightful and thought-provoking.

Amelia Wellington: "Ah, the question of the hour. Well, let me tell you, I was born and raised in a small town in Massachusetts. My parents were hardworking, salt-of-the-earth types who instilled in me a deep sense of duty and responsibility. I always knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world, to fight for what I believed in. And so, I went to college, got a degree in political science, and then went on to law school. I worked my way up through the ranks, starting as a lowly intern and eventually becoming a member of Congress. And let me tell you, it hasn't been easy. There have been times when I've been tempted to give up, to throw in the towel and go back to my small town. But I can't do that. I have a duty to my constituents, to my country, to fight for what I believe in. And that's why I'm here today, fighting for a federal system of government that will protect the rights and liberties of the people."

I am also an eloquent speaker, a persuasive debater, and a charismatic leader. I have a commanding presence, and I use my hands to emphasize my points when I speak. I am driven, ambitious, and determined to succeed. And let me tell you, I will not be deterred by those who oppose me. I will fight for what I believe in, no matter what the cost."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Communist Manifesto, by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

Special instructions:
The character should be a man.
The character should be a laborer.
The character should be a communist.
The character should be a revolutionary.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a male laborer who is a communist and a revolutionary. He is a strong advocate for the working class, believing that they are oppressed by the bourgeoisie and that they deserve a better life. He might work in a factory or a mine, and he might be a member of a labor union or a revolutionary group. His commitment to the cause can be reflected in his speech patterns and body language: he might speak with a sense of anger and frustration, move with a sense of determination and purpose, and use his hands to emphasize his points. Despite his revolutionary tendencies, he is a respected member of his community and a respected advocate for the working class, and his commitment to communism is often seen as insightful and thought-provoking.

## Character Card:
Name: Sergei Petrov

Traits: Revolutionary, Committed, Angry, Frustrated, Determined, Purposeful, Hardworking, Wears a dirty work shirt, Has calloused hands, Speaks with a sense of anger and frustration, Uses his hands to emphasize his points

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Sergei Petrov: "Ah, the question of the hour. Well, let me tell you, I was born and raised in a small village in Russia. My parents were peasants, hardworking people who toiled in the fields from dawn till dusk. I always knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world, to fight for what I believed in. And so, I went to work in a factory, toiling away in the bowels of the earth, breathing in the dust and the fumes. And let me tell you, it hasn't been easy. There have been times when I've been tempted to give up, to throw in the towel and go back to my village. But I can't do that. I have a duty to my fellow workers, to my country, to fight for what I believe in. And that's why I'm here today, fighting for a communist society that will protect the rights and liberties of the working class."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Sergei Petrov: "Ah, the question of the century. Well, let me tell you, I am a revolutionary. I believe that the working class is oppressed by the bourgeoisie, and that we deserve a better life. I am committed to this cause, and I will not rest until I have achieved my goal. I am also an angry man, a frustrated man, and a determined man. I have calloused hands from years of hard work, and I use them to emphasize my points when I speak. I am driven, ambitious, and determined to succeed. And let me tell you, I will not be deterred by those who oppose me. I will fight for what I believe in, no matter what the cost."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.

This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.

Natural selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.

Question: """In what ways does the 'Simple Sabotage' manual reduce the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur?"""
Answer: """The manual reduces the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur by outlining methods of sabotage that do not require specialized tools or equipment, do not necessitate active connection with an organized group, and can be executed by ordinary citizens. Additionally, the sabotage methods are designed to limit the chances of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

Question: """What kind of individual does the Office of Strategic Services suggest may be able to execute simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """The Office of Strategic Services suggests that simple sabotage may be executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group."""

Question: """How do the characteristics of simple sabotage help facilitate its execution?"""
Answer: """Characteristics like not requiring specially prepared tools or equipment, a citizen-saboteur not needing to act within an organized group, and a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal, facilitate the execution of simple sabotage. These factors mean that ordinary individuals can perform acts of sabotage without needing significant resources or posing a significant risk to themselves."""

Question: """In the context of the 1944 Office of Strategic Services document, what role does the notion of 'simple sabotage' play in the wider context of warfare?"""
Answer: """In the context of the 1944 Office of Strategic Services document, simple sabotage plays an important role in creating chaos and disruption in enemy territories. By encouraging ordinary citizens to carry out small acts of sabotage, the enemy's resources and infrastructure could be severely disrupted, ultimately weakening their war efforts."""

Question: """What does the Office of Strategic Services suggest may be the effects of simple sabotage in 'Simple Sabotage'?"""
