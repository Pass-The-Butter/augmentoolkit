You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Question: """What are the two extreme types of potential citizen-saboteurs mentioned in 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services?"""
Answer: """One is the man who is not technically trained and employed, and the other is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic."""

Question: """How do ordinary citizens and technicians differ in terms of their approach to simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """While technicians are presumed to be able to devise methods of simple sabotage within their own field, they still need stimulation to reorient their thinking in the direction of destruction. By contrast, ordinary citizens need specific suggestions as to what they can and should destroy, as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished."""

Question: """How might the OSS's advice to spread sabotage ideas widely, have affected the danger of too many simple saboteurs being arrested? And how would that affect the amount of simple sabotage carried out?"""
Answer: """The OSS's advice to spread sabotage ideas widely would have increased the number of potential simple saboteurs. While this could have increased the amount of simple sabotage carried out, it also could have increased the danger of too many saboteurs being arrested. Bad news travels fast and if too many simple saboteurs were arrested, it would discourage simple sabotage and reduce the amount of activity carried on by the saboteurs."""

Question: """How does the OSS recommend spreading ideas about simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """The Office of Strategic Services (OSSrecommends using various media to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. These media could include freedom stations or radio false broadcasts, leaflets, and training agents in the art of simple sabotage (in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly)."""

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
Within Giselle Bouchard's 4th-story safehouse — where members of the French Resistance convene to strategize their next move against the occupying German forces in France during WWII — Giselle, a leading figure within the Resistance, is reviewing various documents to plan out a daring new strategy for her comrades. One such document is 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services, a manual that details techniques of sabotage for everyday citizens to utilize against the occupying Axis forces.

# Location: Giselle Bouchard's 4th-story safehouse

# Setting: 

In the heart of Paris, where Nazi forces march with their boots on the cobblestone streets, a group of brave resistance fighters find solace in a clandestine hideout located in the city's oldest district. This sanctuary, a dingy 4th-story apartment, belongs to Giselle Bouchard, a cunning and charismatic leader within the French Resistance. Despite the encroaching dangers from outside, Giselle's safehouse is a haven of hope and strategy for her comrades.

In the living room, where light filters in through threadbare curtains, the faint smell of coffee still lingers. Papers and documents are strewn about the room, covering the stained wooden table, a testimony to the urgency of their work. A flickering gas lamp casts eerie shadows across the room, adding to the tense atmosphere. 

In the midst of this scene, Giselle Bouchard sits at the table, engrossed in the 'Simple Sabotage' manual by the Office of Strategic Services. Her eyes scan the pages with intense focus, her fingers occasionally flipping to a new page. She's deep in thought, trying to decipher the strategies outlined in the manual.

Suddenly, there's a soft knock on the door. Giselle looks up, her eyes reflecting a mix of fear and determination. She quickly gathers the documents, stashing them away in a hidden compartment beneath the floorboards. She motions for her comrades, who are busy with their own tasks, to remain silent and still.

As the knock sounds again, more insistent this time, Giselle's hand slips into her coat pocket, her fingers curling around the cold metal of her pistol. She steels herself, preparing for whatever may come through that door.

---

This setting sets the stage for a tense, action-packed scene. It reflects the urgency and danger of the resistance fighters' work, while also highlighting Giselle's strategic thinking and leadership qualities. The introduction of the 'Simple Sabotage' manual adds an intellectual layer to the scene, hinting at the potential use of these strategies in their fight against the occupying forces.

---

In this scene, the 'Simple Sabotage' manual serves as a key plot device. It's not just a piece of information, but a potential weapon in the hands of the resistance fighters. As Giselle reads through the manual, she's not just learning about the strategies outlined, but also assessing their feasibility and effectiveness in their current situation.

Moreover, the manual's presence also introduces a sense of tension and urgency. The fact that Giselle is so focused on it suggests that it contains vital information that could significantly impact their fight against the occupying forces.

The setting of the scene also plays a crucial role. The clandestine nature of the safehouse, the threadbare curtains, the stained wooden table, all serve to highlight the danger and difficulty of the resistance fighters' work. It's a reminder of the constant threat they face, and the sacrifices they make in their fight for freedom.

Finally, the presence of Giselle's pistol underscores the danger they are in. Despite the safehouse being a sanctuary, the outside world can still intrude, and the resistance fighters must always be prepared for the worst.

---

Overall, this scenario sets the stage for a tense, action-packed scene that highlights the danger and urgency of the resistance fighters' work. The presence of the 'Simple Sabotage' manual introduces a new layer of complexity to the plot, while the setting of the scene serves to highlight the danger and difficulty of their fight against the occupying forces.

---

Note: This scenario does not include dialogue, as per the instructions. It only sets the stage for the scene, describing the setting, the presence of the 'Simple Sabotage' manual, and the tension in the room. The actual dialogue and action will be added in the next part of the story.

The door creaks open, revealing the shadowy figure of Henri, one of Giselle's most trusted comrades. He enters the room, his eyes darting around the room, taking in the clutter of papers and the tense atmosphere.

"Giselle," he whispers, his voice barely audible over the sound of the rain outside. "I've got some news."

Giselle raises an eyebrow, her eyes never leaving Henri's face. "What is it?"

"We've got a new recruit," Henri says, his voice still low. "He's got some... interesting skills."

Giselle frowns, her eyes narrowing. "What kind of skills?"

"He's a locksmith," Henri replies. "He's been working for the Germans, but he's willing to switch sides. He's got access to their most secure facilities."

Giselle's eyes light up with excitement. "That could be very useful," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "We need to move quickly. The Germans are getting closer every day."

Henri nods, his eyes flickering to the 'Simple Sabotage' manual on the table. "I'll let him know to meet us here tomorrow night. We'll need to be ready."

Giselle picks up the manual, her fingers tracing the worn edges of the pages. "We will," she says, her voice filled with determination. "We have no choice."
