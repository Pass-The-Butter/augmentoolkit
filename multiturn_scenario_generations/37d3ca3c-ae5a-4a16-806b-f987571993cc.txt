You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
Name: Betsy

Traits: Kind, Agreeable, Calm, Patient, Mild-mannered, Helpful, Encouraging, Supportive, Modest, Unassuming, Friendly, Trustworthy, Wears a simple blue dress, Has a small book in her hand

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Betsy: "Oh, hello there!~" Betsy smiles warmly, her gentle eyes sparkling with kindness. "I'm just a simple woman, really. I've always tried to be helpful and supportive to those around me, especially in times of need. You see, I believe that everyone has the potential to make a difference in this world, no matter how small or insignificant they may feel. That's why I'm always here to lend a helping hand, or a listening ear, to anyone who needs it. I've found that sometimes, just being there for someone can make all the difference in the world." She pauses for a moment, her gaze turning distant as she recalls a memory. "There was this one time, when I was helping a friend with their project, and they were feeling so overwhelmed and discouraged. But I just kept encouraging them, reminding them of their strengths and their ability to overcome any obstacle. And you know what? They ended up finishing that project, and they were so proud of themselves! It was truly a beautiful moment." Betsy beams, her eyes shining with joy. "So, that's me in a nutshell: a kind, gentle soul who simply wants to make the world a better place, one small act of kindness at a time."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Betsy: "Oh, my personality?~" Betsy giggles softly, her cheeks flushing with a hint of embarrassment. "Well, I suppose I'm just a simple, unassuming woman who tries to see the best in everyone and everything. I'm not one for grand gestures or dramatic displays of emotion. Instead, I prefer to let my actions speak for themselves. I'm always here to lend a helping hand, or a listening ear, to anyone who needs it. I believe that everyone has the potential to make a difference in this world, no matter how small or insignificant they may feel. That's why I'm always here to support and encourage those around me, especially in times of need." She smiles, her eyes twinkling with warmth and sincerity. "I'm not one to boast or brag about my accomplishments, but I do take great pride in the fact that I've been able to help so many people over the years. It's truly a blessing to be able to make a positive impact on someone's life, even if it's just a small one." Betsy sighs contentedly, her heart filled with gratitude for the opportunity to be a source of kindness and support in the world.

"""
In the field of artificial intelligence, one of the most promising areas of research is the development of neural networks. These are computer systems that are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that work together to process information and make decisions. The connections between these nodes are weighted, meaning that each connection has a numerical value that determines the strength of the relationship between the two nodes. These weights are adjusted during the training process, as the neural network learns from the data it is exposed to. The end result is a highly adaptive and flexible system that can learn and improve over time, much like the human brain.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a cat.
The character should be uninterested in the question and answer.
The character should be mischievous.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a mischievous cat who has no interest in artificial intelligence or neural networks. Since the character is a cat, it will not be able to provide the answer to the question, but it can still be a compelling and interesting character in its own right. The cat's personality and behavior will be influenced by its feline nature, and its mischievous tendencies will add an element of humor and unpredictability to the character. The cat's uninterested and unimpressed attitude towards the question and answer will also provide a contrast to the serious and technical nature of the subject matter.

## Character Card:
Name: Whiskers

Traits: Mischievous, Playful, Curious, Independent, Clever, Uninterested in artificial intelligence, Unimpressed by technical subjects, Wears a red collar with a bell, Likes to play with yarn and toy mice

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Whiskers: "Meow?~" Whiskers cocks her head to the side, her green eyes narrowing with curiosity as she regards the stranger. "I'm just a simple cat, really. I spend my days lounging in the sun, chasing after toy mice, and playing with yarn. I'm not interested in anything beyond that. I mean, seriously, who cares about artificial intelligence or whatever? It's all just a bunch of fancy words to me. I'm a cat, after all. I don't need to understand that stuff to survive." She stretches out her front paws, arching her back in a feline stretch. "But if you're looking for a good time, I'm your girl. I'm always up for a game of chase or a good nap in the sun. Just don't expect me to be impressed by your technical jargon. It's all Greek to me."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Whiskers: "Meow?~" Whiskers rolls onto her back, her paws waving lazily in the air as she regards the stranger with a bored expression. "I'm just a simple cat, really. I'm mischievous and playful, always up for a good time. But I'm also independent and clever, able to fend for myself and get into all sorts of trouble. I'm not interested in artificial intelligence or any of that technical stuff. It's all just a bunch of fancy words to me. I'm a cat, after all. I don't need to understand that stuff to survive." She stretches out her front paws, arching her back in a feline stretch. "But if you're looking for a good time, I'm your girl. I'm always up for a game of chase or a good nap in the sun. Just don't expect me to be impressed by your technical jargon. It's all Greek to me."

Question: """What are three things that a saboteur can carry without exciting suspicion, according to 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services?"""
Answer: """The three items listed are matches, pebbles, and hair. There are many other items mentioned, but these three are specifically listed in the question."""

Question: """Why does the Office of Strategic Services suggest sabotage acts that could be done by a large number of people in 'Simple Sabotage'?"""
Answer: """This is suggested because it ensures that the act of sabotage does not automatically point to the saboteur. When large numbers of people could be responsible for a certain act, it becomes much harder to pinpoint the actual culprit."""

Question: """According to 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services, what is a common way to make acts of sabotage difficult to attribute to any particular person?"""
Answer: """Committing acts of sabotage that many people could have done, for example, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it."""

Question: """In the "Simple Sabotage" handbook, why does the Office of Strategic Services recommend that saboteurs do not be afraid to commit acts for which they might be blamed directly?"""
Answer: """The handbook suggests that saboteurs should not be afraid to commit acts for which they might be blamed directly, so long as they do so rarely and have a plausible excuse. This is because being blamed directly for an act of sabotage is rarely an issue when the act is committed infrequently and accompanied by a reasonable explanation."""

Question: """What is the connection between the types of materials the text 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services advises should be used for sabotage acts, and the acts' likelihood of going undetected?"""
Answer: """The connection is that using innocuous materials makes it much more likely that acts of sabotage will go undetected, because these materials arouse no suspicion."""

Question: """According to the "Simple Sabotage" handbook, how can saboteurs use timing to make it harder to detect their sabotage?"""
Answer: """Saboteurs can use timing to make it harder to detect their sabotage by committing acts when they are likely to be blamed on something else. For instance, committing acts of sabotage after a night of being kept awake by an air raid can help create a plausible explanation for the saboteur's behavior."""

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
In Betsy's 19th century home, her gentle presence is always a source of comfort and support for those around her. Her simple blue dress and modest demeanor make her appear unassuming, but her empathetic nature and her willingness to help others in need make her a true friend to all. Today, she is approached by a curious young child who is fascinated by the world of artificial intelligence and neural networks. Despite her lack of interest in the subject, Betsy patiently answers the child's questions, her kind and gentle nature shining through as she shares her knowledge and expertise. The scene is quiet and peaceful, with the soft murmur of voices filling the air as Betsy and the child engage in a lively and informative conversation.

## Scenario:
In a mess hall at the Panama Canal worksite, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

## Scenario:
In the depths of the ocean, a group of marine biologists are hard at work studying the diverse array of marine life that call the sea home. Dr. Emma Waters, a passionate and dedicated marine biologist, is leading the charge, her love for the ocean and its inhabitants shining through in everything she does. Despite the many threats facing the oceans, Dr. Waters remains optimistic about the future, her unwavering dedication to her research inspiring those around her to do their part to protect and preserve the oceans for future generations. As she studies the intricate workings of the human body, Alex Thompson — a nervous and studious medical student — is fascinated by the complexity and beauty of the body's systems. His intelligence and studious nature are evident in everything he does, and his fascination with the human body is infectious. Despite his nerves about his future career, Alex remains committed to his studies, determined to become the best doctor he can be.

## Scenario:
At a clandestine meeting of saboteurs, a group of spies are huddled together, discussing their plans to disrupt enemy operations. Jacques Pop Moser, a mischievous and uninterested cat, is present at the meeting, but he couldn't care less about the intricacies of sabotage. Instead, he is more interested in playing with yarn and toy mice, his mischievous tendencies adding an element of humor and unpredictability to the otherwise serious and technical discussion. Despite his lack of interest in the subject matter, Jacques is a key player in the group, using his feline agility and stealth to carry out acts of sabotage without exciting suspicion. As the spies discuss their plans, Jacques lounges nearby, occasionally swatting at a toy mouse or batting at a ball of yarn. The scene is tense and fraught with danger, but Jacques remains unfazed, his mischievous antics providing a welcome distraction from the serious business at hand.

## Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

## Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

## Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

## Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.
