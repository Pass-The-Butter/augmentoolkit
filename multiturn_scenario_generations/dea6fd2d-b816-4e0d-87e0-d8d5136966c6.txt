You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from some questions, answers to those question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the questions and its answers (using only information contained in the questions and answers) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

Question: """How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of linear and quadratic functions in math. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear and quadratic functions in general.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's personalities clash, leading to a subtly erotic and slightly comedic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
"""
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the Panama Canal's construction. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of the Panama Canal's construction's history, the scenario will involve someone curious about the canal's history.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.

Name: Mabel Farnsworth

Traits: Wise, Fortune Teller, Mysterious, Cryptic, Soothing Voice, Enigmatic, Mystical, Knowledgeable, Very Old, Wears a Long Black Dress, Long White Hair, Has a Crystal Ball

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Mabel Farnsworth: "Ah, my dear child, your curiosity is understandable, but I must ask: do you truly wish to know the tale of one who has walked this earth for so long that even the memories of kings and queens have faded away like the morning dew?" Mabel's voice is soft and soothing, like a gentle breeze rustling through the leaves of an ancient tree. "Very well, then. I am Mabel Farnsworth, a humble fortune teller who has spent her entire life studying the stars and the fates of men. I have gazed into the depths of the cosmos and beheld the infinite tapestry of time and space, and I have learned that the greatest mysteries of the universe are often hidden in plain sight, waiting to be discovered by those who possess the courage to seek them out." She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, as if drawing strength from the very air around her. "My journey has been long and arduous, filled with both joy and sorrow, but I have never regretted the path I have chosen. For in the end, it is the journey itself that truly matters, not the destination."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Mabel Farnsworth: "Ah, my dear child, you wish to know the essence of my being, do you? Very well, then. I am a woman of many mysteries, a creature of the night who has walked this earth for centuries, yet remains forever young. I am enigmatic and cryptic, my words often leaving my listeners both intrigued and perplexed. I am a seeker of knowledge, a student of the stars and the cosmos, and I have devoted my life to unraveling the secrets of the universe. I am a soothsayer, a fortune teller who gazes into the depths of the unknown and sees the threads of fate that bind us all together. I am a weaver of destinies, a spinner of tales both ancient and new. I am a woman of wisdom and experience, a sage who has seen the rise and fall of empires, the birth and death of nations, and the ebb and flow of the tides of history. I am Mabel Farnsworth, and I am all of these things, and yet I am none of them. For I am a mystery, a riddle wrapped in an enigma, a puzzle waiting to be solved by those who dare to look beyond the veil of the mundane and into the realm of the infinite."

Question: """How can a fire be started in a warehouse or other inflammable location using a candle and paper?"""
Answer: """To start a fire using a candle and paper, wrap a strip of paper around the base of the candle two or three times. Then, twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper, creating a flame of varying size, heat, and duration depending on the amount of paper used and how much of it is cramped in a small space."""

## Scenario (will have no dialogue, will just set up the scene):
In Mabel Farnsworth's 19th century fortune-telling den, an unusual sight unfolds: a daring individual approaches the ancient and mysterious fortune teller, not for a glimpse into their own future, but to learn a practical and sinister skill. This individual wants to know how to start a fire in an inflammable location using nothing but a candle and paper. Mabel, always the teacher, takes on the challenge and demonstrates the method, her cryptic and mystical demeanor lending an air of intrigue to the otherwise mundane task. The atmosphere is thick with tension and anticipation, as the individual watches intently, taking mental notes of every step.

## Question:
"""How does Pluto's unusual orbital characteristics and its interactions with other planets and celestial bodies affect its position in the solar system and its influence on other celestial bodies?"""
Answer: """Pluto's unusual orbital characteristics include its highly elliptical and inclined orbit, which causes it to move in and out of the solar system at varying distances from the sun. Its interactions with other planets and celestial bodies, such as Neptune, can also affect its position and influence on other celestial bodies. These interactions can cause changes in Pluto's orbit and may also affect the orbits of other celestial bodies in the solar system. Additionally, Pluto's relatively small size and low mass mean that its gravitational influence on other celestial bodies is limited, but it can still have a subtle impact on the orbits of nearby objects. Overall, Pluto's unique orbital characteristics and interactions with other celestial bodies make it a fascinating and complex object of study in the solar system."""

However, the opportunities for discovery and scientific advancement are also significant, including the potential for finding new insights into the origins and evolution of the solar system, the search for extraterrestrial life, and the study of unique geological and atmospheric processes. Future exploration missions, such as the proposed Pluto Orbiter and Lander, could provide even more detailed data and images of the planet and its moons, helping us to better understand this fascinating and complex world."""

## Question:
"""How do the characteristics of Pluto's atmosphere, such as its composition and variability, impact our understanding of the planet's climate and weather patterns?"""
Answer: """The characteristics of Pluto's atmosphere, including its composition, density, and variability, play a significant role in shaping our understanding of the planet's climate and weather patterns. The atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen, with smaller amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. Its density and pressure vary significantly over the course of Pluto's orbit, which can affect the planet's temperature and weather patterns. For example, during Pluto's closest approach to the sun, the atmosphere expands and becomes more variable, leading to changes in the planet's climate and weather. Studying the atmosphere of Pluto can provide valuable insights into the planet's past and potential for supporting life in the future."""

## Question:
"""What is the significance of Pluto's complex and dynamic geological features, such as its mountains, valleys, and plains, for our understanding of the planet's history and potential for habitability?"""
Answer: """The complex and dynamic geological features of Pluto, including its mountains, valleys, and plains, provide important clues about the planet's history and potential for habitability. The presence of water ice on the surface and evidence of cryovolcanism suggest that Pluto may have had a subsurface ocean for billions of years, which could potentially harbor life. The diverse geological features also indicate that the planet has undergone significant geological activity, including tectonic and glacial processes. Studying these features can help us to better understand the planet's past and potential for supporting life in the future."""

## Question:
"""How does Pluto's position in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond Neptune, affect our understanding of the planet's formation and evolution?"""
Answer: """Pluto's position in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond Neptune, provides important clues about the planet's formation and evolution. The Kuiper Belt is believed to be a remnant of the early solar system, and studying the objects within it can help us to better understand the processes that shaped the formation of the planets. The presence of other dwarf planets and small icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt also suggests that Pluto is not unique, but rather part of a larger population of similar objects. Studying Pluto and its neighbors in the Kuiper Belt can provide valuable insights into the early history of the solar system and the formation of planets like Earth."""

## Question:
"""What is the significance of Pluto's complex and dynamic atmosphere, including its haze layers and variable winds, for our understanding of the planet's climate and weather patterns?"""
Answer: """The complex and dynamic atmosphere of Pluto, including its haze layers and variable winds, provides important clues about the planet's climate and weather patterns. The haze layers are composed of small particles of hydrocarbons, which can affect the planet's temperature and reflectivity. The variable winds can also impact the distribution of heat and energy across the planet's surface. Studying the atmosphere of Pluto can provide valuable insights into the planet's past and potential for supporting life in the future."""

## Question:
"""How do the interactions between Pluto and its moons, such as Charon, affect the planet's rotation and orbital characteristics?"""
