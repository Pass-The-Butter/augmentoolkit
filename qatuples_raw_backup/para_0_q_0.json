    "Which of the following material items could be used as tools for sabotage without arousing suspicion?\\n",
    "According to the text, items such as a knife, nail file, matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and air raid can be used as tools for sabotage without arousing suspicion.\\n\\n2.How could sabotage acts be made to appear as if they could have been carried out by large numbers of people?\\nAnswer: Sabotage acts can be designed to appear as if they could have been carried out by large numbers of people by making them look like they could have been accidents or could have been performed by anyone. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it.\\n\\n3.) What tactic involves using materials that appear innocent?\\nAnswer: The tactic that involves using materials that appear innocent is to blend in with the environment and daily life. This makes them virtually undetectable as tools for sabotage until they are used.\\n\\n4.) How can one commit acts of sabotage that might be directly blamed on the perpetrator, but still avoid suspicion, by using plausible excuses?\\nAnswer: According to the text, one can commit acts of sabotage that might be directly blamed on the perpetrator by doing so rarely, and by having a plausible excuse, such as being overtired or distracted due to circumstances beyond one's control, like an air raid keeping one awake all night.\\n\\nAlways remember to express profuse apologies when the act is discovered.",
    "(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time, and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.",
