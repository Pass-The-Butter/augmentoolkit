    "What are the two extreme types of potential citizen-saboteurs?\\n",
    "The two extreme types of potential citizen-saboteurs are the man who is not technically trained and employed, and the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic.\\n\\n2.How do the suggested methods of communicating information about simple sabotage vary according to the different types of potential citizen-saboteurs?\\nAnswer: The suggested methods of communicating information about simple sabotage vary depending on the type of potential citizen-saboteur. For instance, the man who is not technically trained and employed needs specific suggestions and details regarding the tools for destruction, while the man who is a technician might need to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction, with specific examples from any field to accomplish this.\\n\\n3.) Name at least two media that could be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage.\\nAnswer: Among the media which may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage are freedom stations and radio broadcasts, as well as leaflets directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas or general in scope. Alternatively, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly.\\n\\n4.) What factors govern the amount of activity carried on by the saboteur, according to the text?\\nAnswer: The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur is governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many simple saboteurs are arrested.\\n\\\"\\\"",
    "(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many simple saboteurs are arrested.",
