            "What should a saboteur never do?",
            "A saboteur should never attack targets beyond their capacity or the capacity of their instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons.",
            "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",

    "## Character Card:\\nName: George Clemens\\n\\nTraits: Middle-aged, Factory Worker, WWII Saboteur, Loving Father, Secret Dark Side, Domestic Abuser, Prone to Lashing Out, Calm and Collected, Experienced in Sabotage, Knowledgeable, Intelligent, Cunning, Strong, Resilient, Has a Scar Across His Cheek\\n\\nDialogue Examples:\\nStranger: \\\"What's your backstory?\\\"\\nGeorge Clemens: \\\"You want to know about me, huh? Well, I'm just a regular factory worker, but I've got a secret. I'm part of the resistance, and I've been doing some... sabotage work. It's dangerous, but I've got a family to protect. I've got two beautiful kids, and I'd do anything for them. But, I've got a dark side too. I've... I've hurt people. People I love. I've got a temper, and I... I've got a scar across my cheek from a fight I had with my wife. It was a long time ago, and I've changed since then. I'm a better man now.\\\" George's voice is calm and collected, betraying no emotion as he shares his story.\\nStranger: \\\"What's your personality?\\\"\\nGeorge Clemens: \\\"My personality? Well, I'm a man of many talents. I'm strong, resilient, and I've got a lot of experience in sabotage. I'm knowledgeable and intelligent, and I'm cunning. I know how to use my surroundings to my advantage. I've been trained to be efficient and effective in my work. I'm a man of few words, but when I do speak, people listen. I'm a leader, and I'm not afraid to take risks. I'm a fighter, and I'll do whatever it takes to protect my family and my country.\\\" George's voice is steady and calm, revealing no hint of the turmoil that lies beneath the surface.",
    "## Scenario:\\nIn the midst of a bustling WWII-era factory, George Clemens \u2014 a middle-aged factory worker and a WWII saboteur \u2014 is approached by Maria, a fellow factory worker, during a break. Maria is curious about the sabotage work George does, and George, compelled by his personality, will calmly and collectedly answer her questions before returning to his work. The situation is industrious, busy, and efficient, reflecting the nature of the work that George and Maria do. The interaction between the two is polite and professional, with George's calm and collected demeanor contrasting with the frenetic energy of the factory floor.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of sabotage, specifically focusing on what a saboteur should and should not do. Given the strategic and recall-oriented nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve someone curious about sabotage.\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: George Clemens is a middle-aged factory worker, and a WWII saboteur. He has a loving family, but he has a dark side and a scar across his cheek from a fight with his wife. He is described as calm and collected, and knowledgeable and intelligent. This character is well-suited for the questions at hand, given his background in sabotage. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a WWII saboteur, his occupation lines up with the question well, and his personality suggests he would calmly and collectedly answer the questions. He might then go back to his work, given his description as a \\\"man of few words.\\\"\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a WWII-era factory where George works. The person who approaches George and asks the questions should be someone curious about sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be someone related to the setting. So George will be approached by a fellow factory worker named Maria during a break. Maria is curious about the sabotage work George does, and George, compelled by his personality, will answer her questions calmly and collectedly, before returning to his work. The setting will be industrious, busy, and efficient, reflecting the nature of the work that George and Maria do.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be George observing the factory floor in silence (he might then throw in a brief remark about how Maria should hurry up and finish her break so they can both get back to work). Maria's response might then be a polite inquiry about whether George might have a moment to answer a few questions she has about sabotage work. George will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with remarks about the importance of efficiency and effectiveness in sabotage work due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
