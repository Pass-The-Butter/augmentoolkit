It also suggests communications facilities including telephone, telegraph and power systems, radio, newspapers, placards, and public notices as well as critical materials such as oil, gasoline, tires, food, and water.",

    "## Scenario:\\nIn the tranquil confines of her convent, Sister Maria Agnes \u2014 a devout, pious, and gentle nun \u2014 is approached by Carlos, a young man who is a member of the resistance movement against the enemy. While Carlos is actively involved in the war effort, Sister Maria Agnes, being kind and committed to helping others, will provide him with guidance on how to carry out effective acts of sabotage. The situation is peaceful and calm, as Carlos seeks Sister Maria Agnes's wisdom and guidance, her soft-spoken voice providing a stark contrast to the violent nature of the war outside the convent's walls. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The three questions ask about different aspects of sabotage acts in times of war. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario could involve someone curious about how to carry out sabotage acts effectively.\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Sister Maria Agnes is a devout, pious, and gentle nun who is committed to helping others and to her faith. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Given her commitment to helping others, her occupation as a nun lines up with the question well, and the convent will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her kind, gentle nature, she will likely respond to the person asking the questions with a mix of compassion and firm resolve. She might provide the person with some words of encouragement after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 3 questions and 3 answers, there will be at least 6 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the convent where Sister Maria Agnes lives and works. The person who approaches Sister Maria Agnes and asks the questions should be someone who is a member of the resistance movement against the enemy, someone who is actively involved in the war effort. This person might be a young man named Carlos, who is seeking Sister Maria Agnes's guidance on how to carry out effective acts of sabotage. The setting will be peaceful and calm, as Carlos seeks Sister Maria Agnes's wisdom and guidance, her soft-spoken voice providing a stark contrast to the violent nature of the war outside the convent's walls. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Sister Maria Agnes greeting Carlos kindly as he enters the convent (in a very gentle manner). Carlos's response might then be him greeting her back (respectfully) and then nervously asking the first question. Sister Maria Agnes will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a compassionate nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
