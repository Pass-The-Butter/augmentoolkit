            "What three suggestions are provided to insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation?",
            "The text provides three suggestions: use materials that appear innocent, commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible, and do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, as long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse.",
            "(b) It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons, time, and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation. Among such suggestions might be the following: (1) Use materials which appear to be innocent. A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage. Matches, pebbles, hair, salt, nails, and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever. If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches, hammers, emery paper, and the like. (2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible. For instance, if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box, almost anyone could have done it. On-the-street sabotage after dark, such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck, is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you. (3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly, so long as you do so rarely, and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work. Always be profuse in your apologies.",

    "## Scenario:\\nIn a dimly lit safehouse, Arthur Johnson \u2014 a timid, nervous, and unsure young man who is a saboteur \u2014 is secretly meeting with a fellow saboteur who wants to learn from him. While Arthur wants to teach his fellow saboteur the best practices of sabotage, he nervously stutters, speaks softly, and apologizes excessively while explaining the best practices of sabotage to the person asking the questions. The situation is tense due to the nature of their work, but it also has undertones of camaraderie and shared commitment to their cause.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The three questions ask recall-oriented questions about the best practices for saboteurs. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve someone curious about the art of sabotage.\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Arthur Johnson is a timid, nervous, and unsure young man who is committed to his cause. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Given his occupation as a saboteur, the setting will involve the tools of his trade. The scenario will be a tutorial on sabotage, where Arthur, compelled by his personality, will nervously stutter, speak softly, and apologize while explaining the best practices of sabotage to the person asking the questions. The setting will be in a safehouse where Arthur is secretly meeting with a fellow saboteur. The secondary character will be a fellow saboteur who wants to learn from Arthur. Arthur might nervously stutter and apologize excessively after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 3 questions and 3 answers, there will be at least 6 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a safehouse where Arthur is secretly meeting with a fellow saboteur. The secondary character will be a fellow saboteur who wants to learn from Arthur. Arthur might nervously stutter and apologize excessively after all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Arthur nervously greeting his fellow saboteur and asking what they want from him (Arthur might also apologize for the meeting being held in such a 'rundown' place). The fellow saboteur's response might be an eager request for Arthur to teach him the best practices of sabotage. Arthur will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with nervous stuttering, soft speaking, and apologies due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\\n\\nNote: The scenario plan does not involve adding negative emotions and tension to the scenario if those don't gel nicely with the character's personality, as per the request.",
