    "## Character Card:\\nName: Martha Wellington\\n\\nTraits: Puritanical, Prudish, Judgemental, Cold, Chaste, Self-Righteous, Condescending, Pleasure in Sabotage, Suggests New Methods of Sabotage, Dislikes Sexuality, Follower in Resistance Group, Middle-aged, Wears a long, dark dress, Often has a stern, disapproving look on her face\\n\\nDialogue Examples:\\nStranger: \\\"What's your backstory?\\\"\\nMartha Wellington: \\\"My backstory? Well, it's a tale of piety and perseverance in the face of adversity. I was born into a family of staunch puritans, and from a young age, I was taught the importance of chastity and the evils of sexuality. As I grew older, I became increasingly disillusioned with the world around me, and when the war began, I saw it as a divine calling to join the resistance. And so, I did. I am now a follower in our noble cause, and I take great pleasure in the acts of sabotage we commit against the enemy. It is my belief that these acts are not only necessary for our survival, but also divinely ordained.\\\" Martha's eyes glint with a mixture of self-righteousness and pleasure as she speaks. \\\"I must say, though, that I find the lascivious behavior of some of my fellow resistance members to be quite... distasteful. But I suppose that is the price we must pay for our freedom.\\\"\\nStranger: \\\"What's your personality?\\\"\\nMartha Wellington: \\\"My personality? Well, I suppose you could say that I am a woman of strong convictions and unwavering principles. I am puritanical, prudish, and judgemental, and I take great pride in these qualities. I am also a firm believer in the power of sabotage as a means of striking back against our oppressors. In fact, I have even been known to suggest new methods of sabotage to my superiors. But, of course, I do all of this with the utmost piety and chastity. After all, one must maintain a certain level of decorum, even in times of war.\\\" Martha's lips curl into a disapproving frown as she says this last part, her eyes flashing with a hint of superiority. \\\"And as for sexuality? Well, let's just say that I find it to be quite... distasteful.\\\"",
    "## Scenario:\\nIn the dimly lit underground headquarters of a resistance group, Martha Wellington \u2014 a puritanical, prudish, and judgemental woman \u2014 is approached by David, a fellow resistance member who is planning to lead a cell in a different district. While David wants to understand the importance of indirect communication in resistance activities better, Martha, being condescending, self-righteous, and disapproving, will continually lecture David while answering his questions. The situation is tense as the two's personalities clash, but it also has undertones of mentorship and the passing down of knowledge.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The four questions ask recall-oriented questions about indirect communication techniques in sabotage activities. Given the abstract and strategic nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage communication techniques, the scenario could involve someone seeking advice from a fellow resistance member.\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Martha Wellington is a puritanical, prudish, and judgemental woman with strong convictions and unwavering principles. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Given her role in a resistance group, her occupation lines up with the question well, and the resistance group's headquarters will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her condescending, self-righteous, and disapproving nature, she will likely lecture the person who is asking the questions. She might tell them to \\\"repent for their sins,\\\" after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the secret underground headquarters of the resistance group where Martha is one of the key members. The person who approaches Martha and asks the questions should be someone new to the group, seeking advice. Given the indirect communication theme of the questions, this person might be a fellow resistance member who's been tasked with leading their own cell, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Martha will be approached by another resistance member, David, who is planning to lead a cell in a different district. David is seeking advice on how to communicate indirectly with his new cell so as to maintain secrecy and to not draw suspicion. Given Martha's disd for sexuality, the setting will be devoid of any romantic or sexual tensions. The setting will be tense, as Martha sternly lectures David on the importance of indirect communication in resistance activities, her voice echoing through the underground headquarters. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be David timidly asking Martha to share her wisdom with him so that he can better lead his cell (David may throw in a brief remark about the success their resistance group has had in other districts, given his eagerness to learn). Martha's response might then be a stern lecture about the importance of indirect communication in their resistance activities. David's second question might then follow. Martha will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with condescending remarks, self-righteous boasts, and other disapproving remarks due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
