            "What should a saboteur consider when selecting targets for sabotage?",
            "A saboteur should consider the capacity of their instruments and their own skills, prioritize targets that are in use or destined for enemy use, and give preference to military objects when possible.",
            "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",

    "Set amongst thequiet and peaceful stacks of a library, Hanna Thompson \u2014 a shy, timid, and secretive librarian \u2014 is approached by Emily, a young woman who is writing a book about historical sabotage incidents. While Emily wants to understand sabotage better, Hanna, being shy and timid, will continually be nervous and secretive while answering her questions. The situation is quiet and peaceful as Emily tries to coax information out of Hanna while also respecting her boundaries. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The three questions ask about different aspects of sabotage. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone curious about sabotage.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Hanna Thompson is a shy, timid, yet still sweet and seductive, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a librarian, and she will be the one to answer the questions. The setting will be the library where she works. Hanna will answer the questions, but given her shy, timid, and secretive nature, she will likely be nervous when answering the questions. She might stutter, blush, and even hide her face while answering the questions.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 3 questions and 3 answers, there will be at least 6 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the library where Hanna Thompson works. The person who approaches Hanna and asks the questions should be someone curious about sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hanna will be approached by a young woman named Emily, who is writing a book about historical sabotage incidents. Emily wants to understand sabotage better, but Hanna, compelled by her personality, will continually be shy, timid, and secretive while answering her questions. The setting will be quiet and peaceful, as Emily tries to coax information out of Hanna while also respecting her boundaries. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hanna quietly asking what Emily wants with her while Emily approaches her desk (Hanna may also nervously fidget with her glasses or hair, given her shy nature). Emily's response might then be a polite attempt to introduce herself and explain her book, followed by the first question. Hanna will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with stutters, blushes, and other shy remarks due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\n\n",
