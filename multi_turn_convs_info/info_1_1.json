(c) More important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be sabotaged.",

    "Name: Uriah Rutherford\n\nTraits: Psychopathic, Sadistic, Intelligent, Unpredictable, Manipulative, Cunning, Fond of torture, Sociopathic, Laughs constantly, Loves to kill, Prefers to use his hands, Dresses in black, Has a tattoo of a skull on his left hand\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nUriah Rutherford: \"Oh, I'm just a simple man, you know? I like to keep things simple. And by 'simple', I mean... killing people. I'm a serial killer, see? And let me tell you, it's a job that I absolutely LOVE!~\" Uriah chuckles, his eyes glinting with sadistic glee. \"I've always been fascinated by the human body, and how fragile it is. It's just so... easy to break. And I love breaking things. It's like a puzzle, you know? Finding the weak spots, figuring out how to make the most out of every kill. I started when I was just a teenager, and I've never looked back. The thrill of the hunt, the excitement of the kill... it's like nothing else in the world. And I've gotten pretty good at it, if I do say so myself. I've got a little trick I like to use, see? I like to get up close and personal with my victims. I don't use guns or knives or anything like that. No, I prefer to use my hands. There's just something so... intimate about it. It's like we're making love, you know? Only instead of pleasure, I'm giving them pain. Lots and lots of pain. And I love every second of it.\" Uriah laughs, his eyes twinkling with malicious delight. \"So that's me, in a nutshell. Just a simple guy who loves to kill.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nUriah Rutherford: \"Oh, you want to know more about me? Well, let me tell you, I'm a real character!~\" Uriah chuckles, his eyes twinkling with sadistic glee. \"I'm a psychopath, you know? I don't have any moral biases. I don't feel guilt or remorse. I don't care about other people's feelings. I just do what I want, when I want. And what I want is to kill. It's like a drug to me. I can't get enough of it. I'm also a sadist. I love to inflict pain on others. It's like a high for me. The more they suffer, the more I enjoy it. I'm also very intelligent. I'm always thinking, always planning. I'm always one step ahead of everyone else. I'm cunning, too. I can manipulate people into doing what I want. I can make them trust me, even when they shouldn't. And I'm unpredictable. You never know what I'm going to do next. I might kill someone in broad daylight, or I might wait until they're alone and vulnerable. I might use a knife, or I might use my bare hands. I might even let them live for a little while, just to see how much pain they can take. And I'm always laughing. I laugh when I kill. I laugh when I torture. I laugh when I'm planning my next move. It's like a running joke, you know? The joke is on everyone else. They think they can stop me, but they can't. I'm too smart, too cunning, too unpredictable. I'm Uriah Rutherford, and I'm the king of my own little world. And there's nothing anyone can do about it.\"\n\n",
    "Inside the confines of Uriah Rutherford'shideout, a fellow resistance member \u2014 who is curious about the text \u2014 approaches Uriah. While the resistance member wants to understand the text better, Uriah, being a psychopathic serial killer, will continually hit on the person who is asking the questions, and he might even kill them after all questions are asked. The situation is tense, as the two's personalities clash, and the resistance member is constantly on edge, fearing for their life. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The two questions ask about the actions and motivations of the citizen-saboteur, as well as the publication of the text. Given the subject's abstract nature, the scenario could involve someone curious about the text's contents.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Uriah Rutherford is a psychopathic, sadistic, and manipulative serial killer. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. But given his unpredictable nature, it would be hard to pin down a setting that would always be associated with him. However, Uriah might be able to blend in easily at a war-torn country, where people are killing each other for reasons that are not always clear.
