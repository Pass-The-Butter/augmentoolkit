For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use.

(e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others.

I don't really know what to say... I'm just a... a woman, I suppose.\" Betsy's face turns a bright shade of red as she fidgets with her long dress, avoiding the stranger's gaze. \"I-I mean, I-I'm not... I'm not just a woman, of course, I-I have... I have a job, I-I do things, I-I'm not just... I'm not just a woman!\" She stammers, her voice growing quieter and quieter as she speaks. \"I-I work in... in a factory, I-I help make things, important things, things that are used by the enemy, and I-I try to... to make sure they're not as good as they could be, you know? I-I try to... to make sure they're not as good as they could be.\" Betsy's face turns an even brighter shade of red as she finishes her sentence, her voice barely a whisper. \"I-I don't know why I'm telling you this, I-I shouldn't be telling you this, it's not... it's not proper.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nBetsy Cromwell: \"I-I don't know what you mean... I-I'm just a woman, I-I don't have a personality, I-I just... I-I just do what I'm supposed to do.\" Betsy's face turns a bright shade of red as she speaks, her voice barely above a whisper. \"I-I try to be... I-I try to be...

    "Amidst the surroundings of 19th century factory, Betsy Cromwell \u2014 a timid, repressed, and proper woman who works as a saboteur \u2014 is approached by Mr. Johnson, the factory foreman. While Mr. Johnson wants to understand how Betsy makes her decisions, Betsy, being timid and proper, will continually blush, apologize, and speak in hushed tones while answering his questions, as she believes it's improper to discuss such things. The situation is tense, as Mr. Johnson tries to coax answers out of Betsy, her stress and the constant wear of her repressed nature on her sanity being evident in her actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask about the principles and considerations that a saboteur should follow. Given the strategic and tactical nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve someone who is a saboteur, or at least is interested in sabotage.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Betsy Cromwell is a timid, repressed, and proper woman, but she also works as a saboteur in a factory. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Given her job, her occupation lines up with the question well, and the factory will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her timid and proper nature, she will likely speak in hushed tones, blush, and avoid eye contact while answering the questions. She might even apologize for answering them, as she believes it's improper to discuss such things openly.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a factory where Betsy works. The person who approaches Betsy and asks the questions should be someone who is also interested in sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a fellow saboteur, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Betsy will be approached by a factory foreman\u2014Mr. Johnson\u2014who has noticed that Betsy has been doing excellent work lately. He wants to understand how she makes her decisions, but Betsy, compelled by her personality, will continually blush, apologize, and speak in hushed tones while answering his questions, as she believes it's improper to discuss such things. The setting will be tense, as Mr. Johnson tries to coax answers out of Betsy, her stress and the constant wear of her repressed nature on her sanity being evident in her actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Mr. Johnson complimenting Betsy's recent work, and then (politely) asking her what her secret is (Mr. Johnson might be genuinely curious). Betsy's response might then be a series of apologies and blushes, followed by the first question. Betsy will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with apologies, blushes, and other timid remarks due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\n\n",
