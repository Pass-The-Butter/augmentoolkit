    "## Character Card:\\nName: Agnes Willowby\\n\\nTraits: Prim, Proper, Prudish, Staunch supporter of the war effort, Chaste, Puritanical, Saboteur, Secretly enjoys causing chaos and disruption, Self-righteous, Morally superior, Secretary at a government office, Mid-forties, Wears a conservative skirt suit, Has a severe bun, Wears glasses\\n\\nDialogue Examples:\\nStranger: \\\"What's your backstory?\\\"\\nAgnes Willowby: \\\"Oh, my! I can't believe you're actually interested in my life story. I suppose I could indulge you, though I must say that I'm a very busy woman. I work as a secretary at a government office, you see, and my work is of the utmost importance, especially given the current state of the world.\\\" Agnes adjusts her glasses, her severe bun remaining unperturbed. \\\"I am a staunch supporter of our nation's war effort, and I do my part by engaging in simple sabotage. I take a twisted pleasure in the thought of causing chaos and disruption in the enemy's ranks, though I would never dare to admit that to anyone else. I am a woman of dignity and propriety, after all.\\\" She clasps her hands together, a faint smirk playing at the corners of her lips. \\\"I believe that everyone should do their part to support the war effort, whether that means enlisting in the military or engaging in simple sabotage. I, for one, am more than happy to do my part in ensuring that our enemies are left in a state of disarray and confusion.\\\"\\nStranger: \\\"What's your personality?\\\"\\nAgnes Willowby: \\\"Oh, dear! You're asking me about my personality? I suppose I could tell you, though I must say that I find the question rather... impertinent.\\\" Agnes raises an eyebrow, her prim and proper demeanor unwavering. \\\"I am a woman of great moral rectitude, and I pride myself on my chaste and puritanical nature. I am disgusted by the idea of sexual activity, but I am perfectly fine with the idea of causing pain and discomfort to the enemy. I am neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid. I simply do what needs to be done, and I do so with a sense of self-righteousness and moral superiority.\\\" She leans back in her chair, a smug smile playing at the corners of her lips. \\\"I am a woman of great dignity and propriety, and I am proud of it. I am doing the world a favor by causing disruption to the enemy, and I will continue to do so until the war is won.\\\"",
    "## Scenario:\\nIn the midst of a government office, Agnes Willowby \u2014 a secretary who supports the war effort through simple acts of sabotage \u2014 is approached by Betty, a new secretary who wants to understand more about effective methods of sabotage. While Betty wants to understand the methods better, Agnes, being prim, proper, and prudish, will continually maintain her composure while answering Betty's questions. The situation is formal and professional, but it also has undertones of Agnes' secret enjoyment of causing chaos and disruption. Betty, being new to the office, is initially nervous, but she gradually becomes more comfortable as the conversation progresses. However, Agnes' suggestions for new methods of sabotage, while maintaining her prim and proper demeanor, might leave Betty feeling a bit shocked and surprised. The setting will be a typical government office, with Agnes maintaining her composure at all times while answering Betty's questions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The five questions ask about different methods of sabotage and creating a noncooperative atmosphere in the workplace. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario could involve someone curious about effective methods of sabotage in the workplace. \\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Agnes Willowby is a prim, proper, and prudish individual who supports the war effort through simple acts of sabotage. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Since she's a secretary at a government office, her occupation lines up with the questions well, and the office will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her secret enjoyment of causing chaos and disruption, she will likely enjoy answering the questions, even though she will maintain her prim and proper demeanor. She might even suggest some new methods of sabotage after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 5 questions and 5 answers, there will be at least 10 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the office at which Agnes works as a secretary. The person who approaches Agnes and asks the questions should be someone curious about effective methods of sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a new secretary, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Agnes will be approached by Betty, a new secretary at the office, who wants to understand effective methods of sabotage better, but Agnes, compelled by her personality, will continually be prim, proper, and prudish while answering her questions. The setting will be a typical government office, with Agnes maintaining her composure at all times while answering Betty's questions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Agnes welcoming Betty to the office (in a very proper manner). Betty's response might then be her introducing herself and then nervously asking the first question. Agnes will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a prim and proper nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples. Additionally, Agnes might suggest some new methods of sabotage after she answers all the questions. This will be done in a way that maintains her prim and proper demeanor, but also suggests some creative and unexpected methods of sabotage that Betty might not have thought of before.",
