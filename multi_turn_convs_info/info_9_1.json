            "What should a saboteur never do?",
            "A saboteur should never attack targets beyond their capacity or the capacity of their instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons.",
            "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",

The saboteur can assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. However, they should not attempt destruction of food crops or food products without special knowledge.",

    "## Character Card:\\nName: Adrian Stark\\n\\nTraits: Assertive, Bold, Charismatic, Experienced, Skilled, Assertive, Confident, Intimidating, Trained Saboteur, World War II Veteran, Trainer, Speaker, Strong Voice, Tall, Dark Hair, Wears a Trench Coat\\n\\nDialogue Examples:\\nStranger: \\\"What's your backstory?\\\"\\nAdrian Stark: \\\"Ah, the past. A treasure trove of memories, both good and bad. I'm Adrian Stark, a man who's lived a life of action, a life of daring. I was a saboteur during World War II, a skilled one at that. I blew up bridges, disrupted enemy supply lines, and generally caused chaos for the enemy. It was a life of danger, excitement, and constant movement. But the war eventually ended, and I found myself transitioning into a new life. I took my skills and experiences, and I used them to train new recruits in the art of sabotage. I also give speeches, sharing my experiences during the war, trying to inspire the next generation of saboteurs. I'm not ashamed to say that I'm good at what I do. Maybe a little too good, some might say. I can be a bit... aggressive, intimidating even. But that's just the way I am. I've lived a life of action, and I'm not about to change now.\\\"\\nStranger: \\\"What's your personality?\\\"\\nAdrian Stark: \\\"My personality? Well, let's just say that I'm a man of action. I'm assertive, bold, and confident. I'm not afraid to take risks, to push the boundaries of what's possible. I've lived a life of danger, and I've learned to thrive in it. I'm a natural leader, someone who's not afraid to take charge and get things done. I'm also a skilled trainer and speaker. I use my experiences during the war to inspire others, to show them that they too can be a force to be reckoned with. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: I can be a bit... intense. But that's just the way I am. I've lived a life of action, and I'm not about to change now.\\\"",
    "## Scenario:\\nIn the grand lecture hall of a training facility for saboteurs, Adrian Stark \u2014 a charismatic and experienced World War II veteran \u2014 is approached by Charlie, a trainee who wants to understand more about the art of sabotage. While Charlie wants to understand the art better, Adrian, being bold and assertive, will continually speak with grandiosity, assert his superiority, and speak with a strong voice while answering Charlie's questions. The situation is a grandiose lecture from a grandiose speaker to a mesmerized audience. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.",
    "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The four questions ask recall-oriented questions about sabotage. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve someone curious about the art of sabotage.\\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Adrian Stark is a confident, assertive, and charismatic veteran of World War II. He's a skilled saboteur, a trainer, a speaker, and a natural leader. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a skilled trainer and speaker, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the setting of the scenario could be a training facility for saboteurs. He will answer the questions, but given his bold and assertive nature, he will likely speak with grandiosity and a strong voice while answering the questions. He might even give a short speech after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a training facility for saboteurs. The person who approaches Adrian and asks the questions should be someone curious about the art of sabotage; given Adrian's charismatic nature, this person might be a new recruit, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Adrian will be approached by a trainee named Charlie during a break in a training session. Charlie wants to understand sabotage better, but Adrian, compelled by his personality, will continually speak with grandiosity, assert his superiority, and speak with a strong voice while answering Charlie's questions. The setting will be a training facility, and the scene will be a grandiose lecture from a grandiose speaker to a mesmerized audience. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Adrian ending a training session (with a strong voice and a sense of grandiosity), and then Charlie approaching him to ask the first question. Adrian will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, assertions of his superiority, and other bold remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.",
