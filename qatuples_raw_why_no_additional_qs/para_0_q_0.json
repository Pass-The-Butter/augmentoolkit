    "What two extreme types of potential citizen-saboteurs are mentioned in the text?\\n",
    "The two extreme types are: the man who is not technically trained and employed, and the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic.\\n\\n2.How does the text distinguish between these two types of potential citizen-saboteurs?\\nAnswer: The text distinguishes between these two types of potential citizen-saboteurs based on their technical background and employment status. The first type is a non-technical person who requires specific suggestions about what to destroy, and details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. The second type is a technician who, presumably, would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage appropriate to their own facilities. However, this technician needs stimulation to re-orient their thinking in the direction of destruction.\\n\\n3.) What media channels are suggested in the text for the dissemination of simple sabotage information?\\nAnswer: The text suggests the use of various media for the dissemination of simple sabotage suggestions and information. These channels include freedom stations, radio false broadcasts, and leaflets, which may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope.\\n\\n4.) How does the text suggest stimulating the thinking re-orientation of a technician toward destruction?\\nAnswer: The text suggests that providing specific examples, which need not be from his own field, can stimulate the thinking re-orientation of a technician toward destruction.\\n\\n5.)

    "(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this. (d) Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. Among the media which may be used, as the immediate situation dictates, are: freedom stations or radio false (unreadable) broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas, or they may be general in scope. Finally, agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage, in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly. (3) _Safety Measures_ (a) The amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. Bad news travels fast, and simple sabotage will be discouraged if too many simple saboteurs are arrested.",
