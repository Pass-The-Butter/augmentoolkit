    "According to the first suggested method, what two items need to be prepared for ignition?\\n",
    "According to the first suggested method, you need to prepare a flame, such as that from a candle, and tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline.\\n\\n2.How do the fuses using grease and gunpowder and the ones using matches differ in their modes of operation?\\nAnswer: The fuses using grease and gunpowder burn slowly without a flame until they reach the grease and gunpowder, at which point they will flare up suddenly. The same effect can be achieved using matches, in which the string runs over the match heads, producing a sudden flame. The advantage of using grease and gunpowder, or matches, is that string burns at a set speed, allowing you to time your fire by the length and thickness of the string.\\n\\n3.) In what context are these ignition and fuse creation techniques suggested for use?\\nAnswer: These ignition and fuse creation techniques are suggested for use in warfare, particularly for destroying enemy records and other types of documents.\\n\\n4.) What are the different methods of ignition and fuse creation suggested throughout the text for use in warfare?\\nAnswer: The different methods of ignition and fuse creation suggested throughout the text for use in warfare are: igniting inflammable materials with a flame from a candle, using a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline, using a fuse soaked in grease and gunpowder, and using a fuse with matches.\\n\\nAs a follow-up question, you could ask: \\\"Which of the suggested methods in the text would be the most effective for starting a fire in an office after hours, and why?\\\"",
    "(2) With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.",
