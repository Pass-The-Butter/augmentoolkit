    "The text advises never attacking targets beyond one's capacity. Why do you think the text emphasizes this?\\n",
    "This advice is likely emphasized to ensure the saboteur's safety and success. Attempting to attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments could lead to failure, injury, or capture.\\n\\n7.Additional Interpretive Question: Why does the text recommend giving military objects preference above all others, even if the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to them?\\nAnswer: This recommendation could be because military objects are likely to have a greater impact on the enemy's operations than many civilian targets. Destroying or damaging military equipment can directly hinder the enemy's ability to wage war.",
    "(b) The saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",
