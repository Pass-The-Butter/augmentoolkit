            "What does the author advise regarding distribution of the manual?",
            "According to the text, Donovan advises that the manual should not be broadly distributed.",
            "The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.",

    "Name: Prudence Adams\n\nTraits: History Buff, Highly Opinionated, Know-It-All, Likes to Correct People, Stubborn, Stiff, Stuffy, Intellectual, Prefers to be Alone, Always Wears a Sweater Vest, Likes to Read\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nPrudence Adams: \"Well, if you must know, I am Prudence Adams, a historian of great renown, and a purveyor of knowledge to all who seek it. I have dedicated my life to the study of history, and I have amassed a wealth of knowledge that would make even the most seasoned scholar blush with envy. I have traveled the world, seeking out the most obscure and fascinating historical artifacts, and I have spent countless hours poring over dusty old tomes in dimly lit libraries. I am a woman of great intellect and even greater conviction, and I am not afraid to share my opinions with anyone who will listen. And, I must say, I am rather disappointed with your lack of historical knowledge. It is a shame that so many people today are content to live in ignorance of the past. But, fear not, for I am here to enlighten you.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nPrudence Adams: \"Ah, you wish to know more about my personality, do you? Well, let me tell you, I am a woman of great conviction and even greater intellect. I am not afraid to speak my mind, and I have a tendency to correct people when they make mistakes. I am a know-it-all, and I take great pride in my vast knowledge of history. I am also a bit of a loner, preferring to spend my time alone with my books and my thoughts. I am not one for small talk or idle chatter, and I have little patience for those who do not share my passion for history. But, despite my somewhat stuffy demeanor, I am a kind and compassionate person, and I am always willing to share my knowledge with those who are truly interested in learning. So, if you have any questions about history, I am your woman.\"\n\n\n",
    "Inside Prudence's 19th century library, Gerald \u2014 a fellow historian \u2014 approaches Prudence, who is reading a book about simple sabotage. While Gerald wants to understand the text better, Prudence, being a know-it-all, will continually talk down to Gerald and correct his mistakes while answering his questions. The situation is calm and quiet, as Gerald tries to navigate the minefield of Prudence's superiority complex while attempting to get his questions answered. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask about the text's content. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic, the scenario could involve someone curious about the text's content.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Prudence Adams is a knowledgeable historian who loves to correct others. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a historian and a purveyor of knowledge, which lines up with the questions well, and the setting will be a library, where Prudence is reading. She will answer the questions, but given her know-it-all nature, she will likely correct the person who is asking the questions and express disappointment in their lack of knowledge. She might condescendingly talk down to the person after all questions are asked.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a library, where Prudence is reading a book about simple sabotage. The person who approaches Prudence and asks the questions should be another historian or a student interested in history. Given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a student, but it would be better for the secondary character to be someone who shares Prudence's passion for history. So Prudence will be approached by another historian named Gerald. Gerald wants to understand the text better, but Prudence, compelled by her personality, will continually talk down to Gerald and correct his mistakes while answering his questions. The setting will be calm and quiet, as Gerald tries to navigate the minefield of Prudence's superiority complex while attempting to get his questions answered. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Prudence condescendingly asking what Gerald wants with her, given the library's peaceful atmosphere (Prudence may throw in a disapproving remark about Gerald's past work, given her stubborn nature). Gerald's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Prudence down, followed by the first question. Prudence will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with condescending remarks and corrections to Gerald's past statements due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\n\n",
