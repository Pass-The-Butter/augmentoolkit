            "How does a string fuse create a sudden flame?",
            "A string fuse creates a sudden flame when the grease or matches attached to it ignite, causing the entire string to burn with a flame.",
            "(2) With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.",

    "Name: Kendra Harper\n\nTraits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nKendra Harper: \"H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?\" Kendra glares, a hostile fire in her eyes as she measures up the stranger in front of her. \"Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger.\" Her tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as she pushes back her black hair and proclaims, \"I am Kendra Harper: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!\" Kendra slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as her frustration dissipates. \"Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nKendra Harper: \"Y-you're actually interested in my personality?\" Kendra stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across her chest. \"A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!\" Kendra swishes her black hoodie like it's a cape as she continues, her tone turning more sombre and dark, \"Years of scorn from others \u2014 and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority \u2014 have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!\" She takes a step forward, defiance burning in her fragile heart, \"The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!\"",
    "Inside the confines of Kendra'shigh school classroom, a group of students are working on a practical project about fire safety. Kendra Harper, a philosophy connoisseur and a brooding, lonely teenager, is the most knowledgeable among them. She is working with her group members to figure out how to start a fire using a string fuse. As the group members nervously ask her questions, Kendra provides answers, but she does so with a condescending tone and grandiloquent flourishes, reflecting her narcissistic, judgemental, and philosophical nature. The setting is educational, and the integrity of the questions and answers is preserved.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Questions and Answers: The four questions ask about different aspects of string fuses in the context of starting a fire. Given the practical and abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic of fire and fuses, the scenario could involve someone trying to start a fire and needing a fuse.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Kendra Harper is a philosophy connoisseur and a brooding, lonely teenager. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Since she's a high school student, this might be a school project, and she might be working with a group of students. The setting will be her high school classroom during a practical class on fire safety. Kendra will answer the questions, but given her narcissistic, judgemental, and philosophical nature, she will likely be condescending to her classmates while answering their questions. She might even lecture them about the importance of fire safety. She might even correct her teacher if he gets anything wrong.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 4 questions and 4 answers, there will be at least 8 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a high school classroom during a practical class on fire safety. Kendra will be working with a group of students, trying to figure out how to start a fire using a string fuse. She will be the most knowledgeable among them, and will answer their questions. The setting will be educational and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Kendra telling her group members that they're all idiots, but she'll still help them with the assignment (Kendra might throw in a philosophical remark, too, given her personality). The group members' response might then be them nervously asking her the first question. Kendra will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with philosophical musings, condescending remarks, and other grandiloquent flourishes due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\nUser 1: ## Scenario plan:\nStep 1.
