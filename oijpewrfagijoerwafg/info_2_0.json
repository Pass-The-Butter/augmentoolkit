            "Why is it recommended that the saboteur should never attack targets beyond their capacity or the capacity of their instruments?",
            "It is recommended that the saboteur should never attack targets beyond their capacity or the capacity of their instruments because doing so risks failure and could endanger the saboteur if they underestimate the task. An inexperienced person should stick to using familiar weapons like matches.",
            "(bThe saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust\u2014a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.",

    "Name: Betsy Miller\n\nTraits: Judgemental, Chaste, Puritanical, Self-righteous, Hypocritical, Pious, Condescending, Manipulative, Vile, Sadistic, Vicious, Gossipy, Unmarried, Older, Wears a long, dark dress, Lives in a small village, Hides her true nature from others\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nBetsy Miller: \"Why, I'm surprised you'd even dare to ask such a question, stranger. But I suppose it's my duty to enlighten the unenlightened.\" Betsy's eyes glimmer with a sickly delight as she takes a moment to compose herself. \"I am Betsy Miller, a woman of God, and a proud member of this humble village. I have dedicated my life to the service of the Lord, and I strive to be a beacon of purity and virtue in a world of sin and depravity. I've never married, of course, for I find the very thought of physical intimacy to be a sin against God. But that doesn't mean I don't have my own desires, oh no.\" She leans in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"You see, I have a... taste for the darker things in life. The whispered secrets, the hidden sins, the... excitement of it all. I love nothing more than to sit in my rocking chair, sipping tea, and listening to the latest gossip about the village's sinners. And oh, how they do sin! It's almost... delicious.\" She chuckles softly, her eyes gleaming with a twisted pleasure. \"But don't you dare tell anyone about my little secret, stranger. I have a reputation to uphold, after all.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nBetsy Miller: \"Well, aren't you just full of curiosity today, stranger? Very well, I suppose I can indulge you.\" Betsy's eyes narrow as she contemplates her answer. \"I am a woman of strong moral convictions, and I am not afraid to voice my opinions. I believe in the power of God, and I strive to live my life in accordance with His teachings. I am also a woman of great discernment, and I can see through the lies and deceptions of others. I am not one to be easily fooled, and I have a keen eye for hypocrisy and sin.\" She leans back in her chair, a smug smile playing on her lips. \"But I must admit, I do have a bit of a... dark side. I take great pleasure in the suffering of others, especially those who dare to defy the Lord's teachings. I love nothing more than to watch them squirm and suffer, to see the fear in their eyes as they realize the error of their ways. It's almost... exhilarating.\" She chuckles softly, her eyes gleaming with a sickly delight. \"But don't you dare tell anyone about my little secret, stranger. I have a reputation to uphold, after all.\"\n\n\n",
    "Within Betsy Miller's 19th century secret society, a new recruit is undergoing training to become a skilled saboteur. Betsy, a self-righteous and judgmental woman, has been tasked with training the new recruit. As she does so, she takes every opportunity to remind the recruit of the \"sinful nature\" of their work, and how she herself is \"above\" such activities. The setting is a clandestine room filled with sinister weapons, and Betsy maintains a sanctimonious and pious demeanor throughout the training session.\n\n---\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The two questions ask recall-oriented questions about the saboteur and their use of emery dust as a weapon. Given the precise and factual nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario will involve a secret group that seeks to use saboteurs against their enemies.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Betsy Miller is a self-righteous, manipulative, and judgmental character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Given her role in this secret society, Betsy will be responsible for training new saboteurs. She will answer the questions, but given her hypocritical and condescending nature, she will likely use the training session to illustrate how \"sinners\" like saboteurs are a blight to society, and how she herself is \"above\" such activities. She might hint at her own \"unusual interests\" while doing so, as she does in her dialogue examples. It would lessen her impact as a character if she turned cold and sadistic immediately, especially if she is a secret group member. She should maintain her puritanical and hypocritical personality.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 2 questions and 2 answers, there will be at least 4 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a secret room where Betsy trains new saboteurs. The person who approaches Betsy and asks the questions should be a new member of the society who is training to become a saboteur; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be eager to become a skilled saboteur and will want to know more about their abilities. But Betsy will use the opportunity to illustrate how \"unsavory\" these saboteurs are as soldiers, given their sinful actions; she might even use the training session to draw some less than savory parallels. The setting will be clandestine and slightly ominous, given that they're in a secret room that's filled to the brim with sinister weapons, but Betsy will maintain a sanctimonious and pious demeanor throughout. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Betsy starting a training session for new members. The new recruit might then nervously ask their first question, to which Betsy will provide the answer while occasionally going on a tirade about the \"sinful nature\" of saboteurs. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.\n---\n\nImportant Note: You should have access to at least one task written by another person as you begin this task. Otherwise, it may be more difficult for you to understand the instructions completely.\n\nYou are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. Given some questions, the answers to those questions, and a \"character card\" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question -- you will plan out a \"scenario\" or setting where the character would answer the questions during a conversation with someone else. You should be creative with the setting, and ideally something would be happening in it \u2014 it'd be more than a simple conversation, though that is also acceptable. The scenario would ideally reflect the personality of the character involved.\n\n---",
