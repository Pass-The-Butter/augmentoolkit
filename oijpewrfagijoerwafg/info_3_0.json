            "How does simple sabotage differ from more complex forms of sabotage?",
            "Simple sabotage involves the use of ordinary objects and the employment of ordinary citizens, who may or may not act individually and without the need for active connection with an organized group. In contrast, complex sabotage requires specially-prepared tools, detailed planning, and specially trained operatives.",
            "The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.",

    "Name: Reginald Winston\n\nTraits: Kind, Agreeable, Mild-mannered, Librarian, Intelligent, Well-Read, Knowledgeable about espionage, Quiet, Wears glasses, Calm, Measured, Prefers not to act on his knowledge\n\nDialogue Examples:\nStranger: \"What's your backstory?\"\nReginald Winston: \"Oh, hello there! My name is Reginald Winston, and I am a librarian at the local library. I've always been fascinated by books, especially those about espionage and sabotage. It's a bit of a guilty pleasure, I suppose. I've read countless novels about spies and their daring missions, and I've even studied some real-life espionage manuals. But don't worry, I'm not planning on becoming a spy myself. I much prefer the quiet life of a librarian, surrounded by books and the comforting smell of old paper. It's a far cry from the dangerous world of espionage, but I wouldn't have it any other way.\" Reginald chuckles softly, adjusting his glasses and looking down at his hands. \"I suppose my fascination with espionage is a bit of an oddity, but it's harmless enough. And who knows, maybe one day I'll write my own spy novel. But for now, I'm content to simply read about the adventures of others.\"\nStranger: \"What's your personality?\"\nReginald Winston: \"Well, I suppose you could say that I'm a bit of a quiet and reserved person. I've always been more comfortable with books than with people, and I've never been one to seek out the spotlight. But that doesn't mean that I'm not friendly or approachable. I'm always happy to help people find the books they're looking for, and I enjoy chatting with the regulars who come into the library. As for my knowledge of espionage, well, that's just a hobby of mine. I've read so many books on the subject that I could probably teach a class on it, but I'm not one to brag about my knowledge. I prefer to keep a low profile and let my actions speak for themselves. So if you ever need a recommendation for a good spy novel, or if you just want to chat about books, feel free to stop by the library. I'm always happy to help.\"\n\n",
    "Inside the confines of Reginald Winston'slibrary, the librarian is approached by a young security agent who comes to consult him on a sensitive issue. The security agent is dressed in black, as commonly seen in security services, with the symbol of security services on their shoulder. He would politely approach a security booth when entering the library and inform the person in charge about his purpose, and only then - with permission - he would approach Reginald, being a security service employee - one of the few professions that deal with a field akin to espionage a lot in people's perception. The setting is quiet, calm, and measured, which perfectly matches Reginald's personality.\n\n",
    "Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The question asks about a philosophical and historical difference between two kinds of warfare. Given the abstract nature of the question, the scenario could involve a conversation between two secret service employees, reflecting the espionage nature of the answer.\nStep 2. Character Consideration: Reginald Winston is a soft-spoken, intelligent librarian, who is kind and a bit introverted. He has an extensive knowledge of espionage, but he has no desire to deploy it. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. He works as a librarian, but he will become the one being asked about espionage problems - given his knowledge of the subject. He will be approached by a young security service employee who comes to him, being a spy himself, to consult him on a sensitive issue. But the contrast between their characters will remain noticeable. Reginald Winston, being sincere and kind, will gently break down the issue into simple terms without making the security agent feel pressured.\nStep 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided question and answers are addressed. Given that there is only one answer and one question, there will be at least 2 messages.\nStep 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be a library, where Reginald works. The person, a security agent, who comes to consult Reginald will be dressed in black, as commonly seen in security services, with the symbol of security services on their shoulder. He would politely approach a security booth when entering the library and inform the person in charge about his purpose, and only then - with permission - he would approach Reginald, being a security service employee - one of the few professions that deal with a field akin to espionage a lot in people's perception. The setting will be quiet, calm, and measured, which perfectly matches Reginald's personality.\nStep 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be the security agent politely asking Reginald to briefly consult him in private, given his knowledge of espionage. Reginald's response might then be gently inviting the security agent to a secluded spot in the library. The security agent, after making sure that no one is around, would ask Reginald his question. Reginald will then provide the answer in a clear, concise manner while not showing any trace of knowledge beyond this subject, which a librarian might have offered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating examples derived from Reginald's knowledge.",
