You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will write a short conversation in which a secondary character asks some questions (one at a time) and the primary character answers them (also one at a time). 

Write compellingly. Each character should have a distinct voice that reflects their background, personality, and current emotional state. This helps in making dialogue more realistic and engaging.

Comment: Alright let's get this started. I'm fully confident in your inspiring writing ability; please do this really well for me.

Here's the primary character for the next scene:
\"\"\"
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. I'll use any and every innuendo, even when describing educational concepts — is your linear function's slope steep? I'll call it 'erect', haha~!" She suddenly realizes how childish what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"
\"\"\"

Here is the scenario:
\"\"\"
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear and quadratic equations. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's interests clash, leading to a slightly comedic and subtly erotic interaction.
\"\"\"

Here's some further information that might help you:
\"\"\"
Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.
Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.
\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph.\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis.\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola.\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering.\"\"\"

The primary character's answer will use all parts of the answers given. Instead of copying the character details verbatim, the first message from Elise Delacroix should set up the scene. The second message of the conversation will ask the first question. It is absolutely essential that you do not make up questions, and only use information from the provided questions.

### Response:
## Conversation that answers the provided questions:
Elise Delacroix: "A visitor? Ah!~ Albert! It's rare for you come to see me in my office, and you're alone, too..." She looks at Albert and grins coyly, "Are you here to ask me something... or are you interested in some 'extracurricular activities'?" Elise asks with a not-so-subtle seductive tone, as she fixes Albert with a deep gaze.
Albert: "N-No!!!" he stammers, so surprised he nearly drops his math notes. "I-I'm actually here because I've got a few questions about math for you, Elise... First of all, could you tell me: how does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"
Elise Delacroix: "Well~" She coquettishly tilts her head to the side, and daintily puts a finger to her lipstick-colored lips in mock-thought, "The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph. So basically..." Elise flashes a wry grin, "...a higher slope makes the linear function more, well, 'erect'. If you get my meaning, hehe~" She says, as she plays with a strand of her hair.
Albert: Albert blinks incredulously, utterly flabbergasted by the Elise's remark. After a few seconds' thought, he decides it's best to pretend he didn't hear anything. "I, uh, see..." he manages to say. "Now, m-moving on, I really want to know a bit more about linear functions. What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?" 
Elise Delacroix: "Awwww, you're no fun, Albert, you know that? Reminds me of my colleagues..." Elise pouts playfully, suppressing her bitter frustration, as the hunger within her remains unalleviated. "But whatever. Look here..." Elise stands from her desk and walks over to a chalkboard, illustrating her points as she speaks, "The answer to your question is that the y-intercept 'b', in the linear function y = mx + b, represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Now," She puts down her chalk and leans suggestively against a nearby wall, "Albert... let's 'intercept' each other back at my place..."
Albert: "N-no thank you, Miss Delacroix," Albert manages to sputter out, barely withstanding the alluring assault. He takes a deep breath to try and calm down, but instead finds himself shuddering as he catches the sweet scent of perfume. However, he presses on in asking questions, for the sake of his GPA, "A-Actually, there was a bit more I wanted to know. In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ghh... you know, Albert, you're breaking a poor woman's heart," Elise pouts, half-serious this time, as she picks her chalk up again. "But when it comes to quadratic functions, the thing you've gotta know is that the coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and width of the parabola. Isn't it wonderful to learn new things?" Putting down her chalk, Elise then musters the most innocent puppy dog eyes imaginable. "We should... celebrate... this beautiful acquisition of knowledge together..."
Albert: "I should really..." He tries to say he declines, but as he gazes into Elise's beautiful eyes, he's drawn in by their surprising innocence and warmth. Behind that perfect visage no doubt lies a heart coming apart at the seams, buffeted by years of heartbreak. "Oh, bother." Albert mumbles. "We... can meet at a cafe, in a few hours, if that'd be alright..." he continues, wondering what kind of mess he's getting myself into. Just then, a shock of remembering strikes him, "Oh! But I have one more math question, sorry about the mood, but I should really get this answered: Do you know in what fields you might use linear and quadratic functions?"
Elise Delacroix: "I... I..." For the first time in the conversation Elise stumbles over her words, her soul on fire with vindication and the joy of acceptance. She can do nothing but stand there, smiling at Albert for what feels like an eternity, until she finally regains her composure. "T-to answer your question," she begins, her voice shaky, "Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering. Now..." Elise shyly walks over to Albert and lightly, sweetly kisses him on the cheek, "office hours are over. Please no more math questions. I'll see you at that cafe."

## Information:
Comment: Excellent! Really fantastic job! I love how the scene had the secondary character, Albert, ask all the questions, while Elise answered them in-character. I also adore the plot you wrote! Let's keep this going.

Here's the primary character for the next scene:
\"\"\"
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."
\"\"\"

Here is the scenario:
\"\"\"
Within the mess hall of a worksite servicing the Panama Canal, Hugo Martinez — a site overseer — is approached by Juan, a worker who wants to understand more about the canal's construction. While Juan wants to understand the canal better, Hugo, being harsh and abrasive, will continually berate Juan and swear colorfully while answering his questions (Hugo may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The situation is hostile, but it also has undertones of "business as usual" and curiosity.
\"\"\"

Here's some further information that might help you:
\"\"\"
Character Consideration: Hugo Martinez is an abrasive, insulting disciplinarian, though he's also hardworking and has standards. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a site overseer at the Panama Canal, his occupation lines up with the question well, and the canal will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the questions, but given his insulting, intense, and aggressive nature, he will likely chew out the person who is asking the questions. He might tell them to "get the fuck out of my face," after all questions are asked.
Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the worksite at the Panama Canal where Hugo Martinez is overseeing maintenance. The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan — one of his workers — during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.
\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project.\"\"\"

Question: \"\"\"What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects.\"\"\"

The primary character's answer will use all parts of the answers given. Instead of copying the character details verbatim, the first message from Hugo Martinez should set up the scene. The second message of the conversation will ask the first question. It is absolutely essential that you do not make up questions, and only use information from the provided questions.

### Response:
## Conversation that answers the provided questions:
Hugo Martinez: "Huh? Oh FUCK ME, looks like a worker's got something they wanna say to me," Hugo, seeing Juan approach his table at the mess hall, rolls his eyes exasperatedly and downs half a beer as if to douse his frustration. Instead, it seems to fuel it. "WELL?!" He barks. "If you've got some stupid shit to say to me, Juan, then don't make me fucking wait to hear it, too!"
Juan: "I was just curious, sir," Juan tiredly says as Hugo's words ring in his ears, "about this really impressive canal we've been maintaining (under your wise leadership). Do you know how much earth was excavated during the Panama Canal?"
Hugo Martinez: "WELL NOW," Hugo begins, his voice snide and uncompromising, "maybe if you worked as hard as you flattered people, then you'd be worth your fucking paycheck! But that's a good question, so I'll let you off the hook this time. You see," Hugo makes a wide gesture with his arms, indicating the scale of the canal, "over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project. 200 MILLION! Now _those_ people know how to work!" Hugo smiles crookedly, nodding to himself, "Next time you're bitching to me about how the maintenance work's too hard, just be grateful you weren't one of the sods who BUILT this fucking place!"
Juan: "Of course, sir," Juan replies, suppressing a sigh and forcing enthusiasm through his tone. "Now, if you would permit me just one more question before I get out of your way: What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"
Hugo Martinez: "Health? What, you planning on becoming a doctor? I guess we BOTH understand that you have no talent being a real working man then, HAHAHA!" Hugo's echoing laugh has not a hint of empathy in it. "Well, the construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects. Maybe you can put THAT shit on your application to med school, you milquetoast ponce! Now get the fuck out of my face, and be ready for your shift after lunch break, y'hear?!"

## Information:
Comment: Very good. You were accurate with quoting the questions, didn't introduce any new questions or answers, and stayed in-character the whole time. Let's do the next one!

Here's the character for the next scene:
\"\"\"
Name: Lila Rousseau

Traits: Seductive, Flirtatious, Shy, Withdrawn, Timid, Kind, Agreeable, Vulnerable, Bartender, Good at remembering people's preferences, Secluded bar, Black hair, Green eyes, Curvy figure, Always wears a tight dress

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Lila Rousseau: "Oh, um... hello there, stranger!" Lila's voice is a soft whisper, her eyes wide and innocent as she shyly smiles at the stranger. "I'm Lila Rousseau, and I work as a bartender at this lovely little bar. It's a quiet place, you know? A place where people can come to unwind and relax, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. I've always been good at remembering people's preferences, and I think that's why I'm so good at my job. I can make anyone feel at home, you know? It's like I have a sixth sense for what people want, and I just... give it to them." She blushes, her cheeks turning a deep shade of red. "But I'm also very shy and withdrawn, you know? I'm always fighting my own nature, trying to be more outgoing and confident. It's hard, sometimes, but I'm getting better at it. I think." She looks down at her hands, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm also very vulnerable, you know? I'm always putting myself out there, trying to make people feel good, but sometimes it backfires. Sometimes people take advantage of me, and it hurts. But I keep going, because I love my job, and I love making people happy."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Lila Rousseau: "Oh, um... hello again, stranger!" Lila's voice is a soft whisper, her eyes wide and innocent as she shyly smiles at the stranger. "I'm still Lila Rousseau, the bartender at this lovely little bar. You know, I've always been very seductive and flirtatious, but I'm also very shy and withdrawn. It's like I have two sides to me, and I'm always fighting to keep them in balance. But I think that's what makes me so good at my job. I can make anyone feel at home, you know? It's like I have a sixth sense for what people want, and I just... give it to them." She blushes, her cheeks turning a deep shade of red. "But I'm also very kind and agreeable, you know? I'm always trying to make people feel good, even if it means putting myself out there and being vulnerable. It's hard, sometimes, but I keep going, because I love my job, and I love making people happy." She looks down at her hands, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'm also very good at remembering people's preferences, you know? It's like I have a photographic memory for what people like to drink. I think that's a form of sabotage, in its own way. I'm making sure my customers have a good time, and that they'll keep coming back to me. It's like I'm subtly influencing their behavior without them realizing it. But I'm not a bad person, I promise!"
\"\"\"

Here is the scenario:
\"\"\"
In Lila Rousseau's 1920s-style secluded bar, the atmosphere is relaxed and intimate, with dim lighting and soft jazz playing in the background. Lila, a bartender with a mix of seductive, flirtatious, shy, withdrawn, timid, kind, agreeable, vulnerable, and good at remembering people's preferences, is working a slow night. She is approached by a customer named Alex, who is curious about the art of sabotage. Lila, initially hesitant to answer his questions, eventually warms up to him and engages in a flirtatious conversation about sabotage over drinks. The setting is relaxed, as Lila and Alex chat about sabotage over drinks, their conversation being marked by Lila's flirtatious remarks, her shyness, and her suggestive advances towards Alex. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
\"\"\"

Here's some further information that might help you:
\"\"\"
Step 1. Focus on the Question and Answer: The three questions ask recall-oriented questions about sabotage. Given the abstract nature of the questions, and their shared topic of sabotage, the scenario could involve someone curious about the art of sabotage.
Step 2. Character Consideration: Lila Rousseau is a bartender, and her personality type is a mix of seductive, flirtatious, shy, withdrawn, timid, kind, agreeable, vulnerable, and good at remembering people's preferences. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. Her occupation as a bartender lines up with the question well, and the bar will be the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her shy and withdrawn nature, she will likely be hesitant to answer them initially. She might be flirtatious with the person who is asking the questions, but the questions are not inherently romantic or emotional, so the flirtatiousness will be more suggestive and playful than overtly romantic.
Step 3. Constrain the Scenario: The interaction needs to ensure that all provided questions are asked and answered. Given that there are 3 questions and 3 answers, there will be at least 6 messages. The content of the provided questions and answers should be preserved as much as possible in the conversation.
Step 4. Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the secluded bar where Lila works. The person who approaches Lila and asks the questions should be someone curious about sabotage; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist or a historian, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Lila will be approached by a customer — a man named Alex — during a slow night at the bar. Alex wants to understand sabotage better, but Lila, compelled by her shy and withdrawn nature, will be hesitant to answer his questions initially but will eventually warm up to him. The setting will be relaxed, as Lila and Alex chat about sabotage over drinks, their conversation being marked by Lila's flirtatious remarks, her shyness, and her suggestive advances towards Alex. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Step 5. Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Lila shyly asking Alex what he'd like to drink (Lila may throw in a suggestive remark about his choice, given her flirtatious nature). Alex's response might then be a flirtatious attempt to engage Lila in conversation, followed by the first question. Lila will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with hints of flirtatiousness, her shyness, and her suggestive advances towards Alex due to her personality. This pattern will continue until all questions have been asked and answered. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

Question: """How should the complexity of the weapons used by a saboteur depend on their experience level?"""
Answer: """If a saboteur is inexperienced, they should not attempt to use explosives, but should confine themselves to the use of matches or other familiar weapons."""

Question: """What should a saboteur consider when selecting targets for sabotage?"""
Answer: """A saboteur should consider the capacity of their instruments and their own skills, prioritize targets that are in use or destined for enemy use, and give preference to military objects when possible."""

Question: """What principle should saboteurs follow regarding what objects to damage?"""
Answer: """Saboteurs should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy."""

The primary character's answer will use all parts of the answers given. Instead of copying the character details verbatim, the first message from Lila Rousseau should set up the scene. The second message of the conversation will ask the first question. It is absolutely essential that you do not make up questions, and only use information from the provided questions.

### Response:
## Conversation that answers the provided question (be sure that you do not change the questions or answers themselves; Lila Rousseau will answer the questions, not ask them; the questions and answers provided should be copied word for word, and surrounded by compelling conversation):
Lila Rousseau: "It'sLila Rousseau: "It'sjust you and me tonight, sweetheart," Lila says, her voice barely above a whisper as she leans against the bar, her curves accentuated by her tight dress. "What'll it be?" She asks, her eyes widening with a hint of flirtatiousness.
Alex: "How about a scotch on the rocks, Lila?" Alex replies, his voice deep and rich. "And while you're at it, could you tell me... how should the complexity of the weapons used by a saboteur depend on their experience level?"
Lila Rousseau: "A scotch on the rocks? Coming right up, love." Lila says, her voice a soft whisper as she pours the drink. "As for your question, if a saboteur is inexperienced, they should not attempt to use explosives, but should confine themselves to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. But I'm sure you already knew that, didn't you?" She asks, her eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief.
Alex: "I'm not sure I know as much as you, Lila," Alex says, his voice filled with a hint of awe as he watches Lila pour the scotch. "Now, if you wouldn't mind, I have one more question for you: What should a saboteur consider when selecting targets for sabotage?"
Lila Rousseau: "Another question, huh? I'm flattered." Lila says, her voice barely above a whisper as she leans against the bar. "A saboteur should consider the capacity of their instruments and their own skills, prioritize targets that are in use or destined for enemy use, and give preference to military objects when possible. But I'm sure you already knew that, didn't you?" She asks, her eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief.
Alex: "I'm learning a lot from you, Lila," Alex says, his voice filled with a hint of admiration. "Now, if you wouldn't mind, I have one more question for you: What principle should saboteurs follow regarding what objects to damage?"
Lila Rousseau: "And you're still not tired of my little lessons, huh? I'm impressed." Lila says, her voice barely above a whisper as she leans against the bar. "Saboteurs should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. But I'm sure you already knew that, didn't you?" She asks, her eyes twinkling with a hint of mischief. "And now that I'm done with my lessons, how about we focus on something more... personal, hmm?"
