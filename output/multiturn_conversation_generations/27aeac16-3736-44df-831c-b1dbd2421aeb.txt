Which is fun and all, but, you know...\" blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. \"THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!\" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. \"Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'\u2014 never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'!

While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his questions. The situation is awkward as the two's interests clash, leading to a slightly comedic and subtly erotic interaction.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nHere's some further information that might help you:\\n\"\"\"\\nCharacter Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.\\nSetting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nInteraction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Elise welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner). Albert's response might then be him greeting her back (hesitantly) and then nervously asking the first question. Elise will then provide the first answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality.

First of all, could you tell me: how does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\"\\nElise Delacroix: \"Well~\" She coquettishly tilts her head to the side, and daintily puts a finger to her lipstick-colored lips in mock-thought, \"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph.

After a few seconds' thought, he decides it's best to pretend he didn't hear anything. \"I, uh, see...\" he manages to say. \"Now, m-moving on, I really want to know a bit more about linear functions. What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?\" \\nElise Delacroix: \"Awwww, you're no fun, Albert, you know that? Reminds me of my colleagues...\" Elise pouts playfully, suppressing her bitter frustration, as the hunger within her remains unalleviated. \"But whatever. Look here...\" Elise stands from her desk and walks over to a chalkboard, illustrating her points as she speaks, \"The answer to your question is that the y-intercept 'b', in the linear function y = mx + b, represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Now,\" She puts down her chalk and leans suggestively against a nearby wall, \"Albert... let's 'intercept' each other back at my place...\"\\nAlbert: \"N-no thank you, Miss Delacroix,\" Albert manages to sputter out, barely withstanding the alluring assault. He takes a deep breath to try and calm down, but instead finds himself shuddering as he catches the sweet scent of perfume. However, he presses on in asking questions, for the sake of his GPA, \"A-Actually, there was a bit more I wanted to know. In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?\"\\nElise Delacroix: \"Ghh... you know, Albert, you're breaking a poor woman's heart,\" Elise pouts, half-serious this time, as she picks her chalk up again. \"But when it comes to quadratic functions, the thing you've gotta know is that the coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and width of the parabola. Isn't it wonderful to learn new things?\" Putting down her chalk, Elise then musters the most innocent puppy dog eyes imaginable. \"We should... celebrate... this beautiful acquisition of knowledge together...\"\\nAlbert: \"I should really...\" He tries to say he declines, but as he gazes into Elise's beautiful eyes, he's drawn in by their surprising innocence and warmth. Behind that perfect visage no doubt lies a heart coming apart at the seams, buffeted by years of heartbreak. \"Oh, bother.\" Albert mumbles. \"We... can meet at a cafe, in a few hours, if that'd be alright...\" he continues, wondering what kind of mess he's getting myself into. Just then, a shock of remembering strikes him, \"Oh! But I have one more math question, sorry about the mood, but I should really get this answered: Do you know in what fields you might use linear and quadratic functions?\"\\nElise Delacroix: \"I... I...\" For the first time in the conversation Elise stumbles over her words, her soul on fire with vindication and the joy of acceptance. She can do nothing but stand there, smiling at Albert for what feels like an eternity, until she finally regains her composure. \"T-to answer your question,\" she begins, her voice shaky, \"Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering. Now...\" Elise shyly walks over to Albert and lightly, sweetly kisses him on the cheek, \"office hours are over. Please no more math questions.

Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!\" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. \"If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya.

The person who approaches Hugo and asks the questions should be someone curious about the canal; given the easy-to-digest nature of the questions, this person might be a journalist, but it would be better for the secondary character to be related to the setting. So Hugo will be approached by Juan \u2014 one of his workers \u2014 during lunch break. Juan wants to understand the canal better, but Hugo, compelled by his personality, will continually be vulgar, berate Juan, and swear while answering his questions (he may drink a bit, too, given that he is an alcoholic). The setting will be hostile, as Juan tiptoes around the tempers of his boss while trying to get his questions answered, his stress and the constant wear of Hugo's fury on his sanity being evident in his actions. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.\\nInteraction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Hugo crassly asking what Juan wants with him during the break (Hugo may throw in a spiteful remark about Juan's past work, given his uncompromising nature). Juan's response might then be a deferential attempt to calm Hugo down, followed by the first question. Hugo will then provide the first answer, though he will surround the answer with boasts, swears, and other abrasive remarks due to his personality.
