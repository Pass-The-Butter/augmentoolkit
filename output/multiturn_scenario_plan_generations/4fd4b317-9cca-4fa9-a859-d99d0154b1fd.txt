Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. \"Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know...\" blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. \"THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!\" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. \"Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'\u2014 never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'!

She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario.
