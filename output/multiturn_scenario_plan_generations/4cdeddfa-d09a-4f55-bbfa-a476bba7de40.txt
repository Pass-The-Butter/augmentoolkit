Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. \"Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know...\" blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. \"THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!\" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. \"Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'\u2014 never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'!

Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario.

Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions.

It can also have secondary results of more or less value, and can harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. It may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, it may encourage natives in enemy or occupied territory to actively assist the United Nations war effort.\"\"\"\n\nQuestion: \"\"\"What challenges does the text identify in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage?\"\"\"\nAnswer: \"\"\"The text identifies several challenges in motivating the citizen to engage in acts of simple sabotage. Acts of destruction do not bring any personal gain to the citizen and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude towards materials and tools. It's often an act that the citizen performs according to his own initiative and inclination.\"\"\"\n\nQuestion: \"\"\"What strategies does the text propose to meet the challenge of inciting citizens to the active practice of simple sabotage and keeping them practicing that sabotage over sustained periods?\"\"\"\nAnswer: \"\"\"The text does not propose any specific strategies to motivate citizen-saboteurs. However, it does suggest that acts of simple sabotage may become more appealing to citizens if they see others engaging in such acts, and if they themselves benefit from these acts (for instance, by feeling a greater sense of identification and solidarity with the United Nations war effort).\"\"\"\n\nQuestion: \"\"\"How does simple sabotage function as a weapon against the enemy?\"\"\"\nAnswer: \"\"\"Simple sabotage functions as a weapon against the enemy by wasting enemy materials, manpower, and time through individual acts. When multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, these acts can create a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy.\"\"\"\\n\\nYou don't need to add negative emotions and tension to the scenario if those don't gel nicely with the character's personality."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Scenario plan:\\nStep 1.
