Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. \"Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know...\" blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. \"THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!\" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. \"Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'\u2014 never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman!

Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the questions, but given her promiscuous nature, she will also repeatedly hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after all questions are asked.\\nStep 3.

Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear and quadratic functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will continually hit on him while answering his questions.

Ah, well, it's a tale as old as time itself: a woman, a spy, and a country she loves more than anything else in this cruel, unforgiving world. I've done things I'm not proud of, things that would make your blood run cold. But it's all in the name of the greater good, isn't it? I've been trained to be a master of espionage and sabotage, and I must admit, I've grown rather fond of the art of fire-based sabotage. There's something... poetic about it, don't you think?\" She smiles wistfully, her eyes glazing over as she's lost in her own thoughts. \"But I can't deny that I feel a deep, unrelenting guilt for the lives I've taken and the destruction I've caused.

Well, I suppose you could say I'm a woman of many faces. I'm assertive and bold when I need to be, especially in my line of work. I'm also quite skilled at what I do, and I'm not afraid to show it. But beneath all that, I'm also quite... secretive. I have my own personal demons that I must contend with, and I don't exactly go around advertising that fact to the world.

Very well, let me demonstrate for you.\" She picks up a candle and a sheet of paper, her movements calm and collected. \"First, you tear a strip of paper about three or four centimeters wide. Then, you wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times. After that, you twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.\" She then strikes a match and lights the candle, her eyes never leaving the flame as it grows higher and higher. \"And there you have it: a simple, yet highly effective method of fire-based sabotage.\"\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nQuestion: \"\"\"What aspects of buildings make them susceptible to simple sabotage, and what types of untrained people can easily carry out such acts in those buildings?\"\"\"\nAnswer: \"\"\"Buildings such as warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are susceptible to simple sabotage because they are very prone to damage, especially by fire.
