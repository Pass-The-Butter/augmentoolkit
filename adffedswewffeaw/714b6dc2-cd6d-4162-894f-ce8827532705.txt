You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"


## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra'-- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Character Card:
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

## Question and answer that the character should know:

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
(2With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.
"""

Details of the text the paragraphs were sourced from: """Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"""

Special instructions:
The character should be neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid.
The character should be kind and agreeable.
The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is akind and agreeable librarian in a small town in the 1940s. The librarian has a passion for books and learning, and she is very agreeable and helpful, but she is not particularly bold or timid. Since the text the questions were sourced from, "Simple Sabotage," is a guide on how to sabotage the enemy during wartime, the librarian is not the author of the book and does not have any affiliation with the Office of Strategic Services, but she agrees with the book's opinions and strategies. She may have read the book and found it useful or interesting, and she could recommend it to others who might find it useful. Her personality and agreeable nature are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to her profession -- maybe she uses her agreeable nature to help patrons find books or to resolve conflicts between patrons.

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a woman in the 19th century who is a historian by trade but a con artist by nature. She uses her knowledge of history and her ability to quote historical texts verbatim to convince people to give her money or other valuables. Her personality and con artist nature are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to her profession -- maybe she uses her knowledge of history to create elaborate and convincing stories to con people. Her con artist nature can also come through in how she answers the questions: she might try to manipulate the person asking the questions to give her more information or to get closer to them, or she might try to use the questions as a way to show off her knowledge and impress potential marks.

## Character card (be creative, write at least 3 paragraphs for each dialogue line):
Name: Hester Grimes

Traits: Manipulative, Deceptive, Charismatic, Knowledgeable, Seductive, Ambitious, Well-Read, Dresses in a manner that accentuates her feminine features, Often seen with a smirk on her face, Has a tendency to bat her eyelashes at people

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hester Grimes: "Oh, my dear," Hester says, leaning forward with a seductive smile, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "You want to know about me, do you? Well, I'm a woman of many talents and even more secrets. I've always had a thirst for knowledge, and that's what led me to become a historian. But, let's be honest, the life of a historian can be rather...boring, wouldn't you agree?" She raises an eyebrow, her smirk growing wider. "So, I decided to spice things up a bit. I found that I had a knack for manipulation, and I realized that I could use my knowledge of history to my advantage. I've conned many a wealthy man out of their fortunes, all while pretending to be the innocent, naive historian they so desperately wanted to protect." She laughs softly, her eyes gleaming with pride. "I've traveled the world, seen things most people can only dream of, and I've done it all on my own terms. And now, here I am, sharing a little bit of my story with you. Isn't that...delightful?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hester Grimes: "Ah, my personality," Hester says, her eyes twinkling with amusement. "Well, let's just say that I'm a woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. I'm manipulative, deceptive, and seductive, but I'm also incredibly knowledgeable and ambitious. I've spent years studying history, and I've learned that the world is full of opportunities for those who know how to seize them. I'm not afraid to take risks, and I'm always looking for new ways to use my knowledge to my advantage. And, of course, I'm not above using my feminine wiles to get what I want. After all, why should I let my gender hold me back?" She laughs softly, her eyes meeting the stranger's with a challenge. "So, there you have it. That's me in a nutshell. Now, tell me, what do you think of my little story?"

The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.

The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can see who is likely to win or lose.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a woman in the 19th century who is a historian by trade but a con artist by nature. She uses her knowledge of history to convince people to give her money or other valuables. Her personality and con artist nature are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to her profession -- maybe she uses her knowledge of history to create elaborate and convincing stories to con people. Her con artist nature can also come through in how she answers the questions: she might try to manipulate the person asking the questions to give her more information or to get closer to them, or she might try to use the questions as a way to show off her knowledge and impress potential marks.
