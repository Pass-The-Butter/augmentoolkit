You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"


## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra'-- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Character Card:
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

## Question and answer that the character should know:

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
It also can be conveyed directly: statements praising the effectiveness of simple sabotage can be contrived which will be published by white radio, freedom stations, and the subversive press. Estimates of the proportion of the population engaged in sabotage can be disseminated. Instances of successful sabotage already are being broadcast by white radio and freedom stations, and this should be continued and expanded where compatible with security. (cMore important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be sabotaged.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is akind, agreeable, and flirtatious woman working as a librarian in a small town during the 1940s. She's very friendly and always willing to help people find what they're looking for, but she also enjoys a bit of harmless flirting with her patrons. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do flirtatious things before or after answering the question, such as batting her eyelashes, smiling coyly, or even offering to help a patron find more books on the topic of sabotage. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to her profession and the special instructions: her kindness and agreeableness will be reflected in her willingness to help people find what they're looking for, and her flirtatiousness will be reflected in her behavior while doing so.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a wise, elderly historian grandmother who loves to tell stories about the past to her grandchildren. She's very kind and loving, and she's always happy to share her knowledge and wisdom with others. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young, innocent child prodigy who is a genius at understanding and interpreting complex texts. Despite his young age, he has a deep understanding of the world and the people in it, and he is able to use his intelligence to analyze and interpret complex texts like The Prince. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into his character and the special instructions; but his language before and after answering the questions, as well as his actions, can still reveal his personality.

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning. His landlady's cook, who always brought him his breakfast at eight o'clock, failed to appear on this occasion. That had never happened before. K. waited for a little while longer, watching from his pillow the old, familiar things around him, but still the cook did not come.

K. got out of bed and put on his bathrobe. It was truly a beautiful day outside, the sun was shining and the sky was a clear, bright blue. K. decided to go to the window and see what was going on. He had hardly taken a step when he heard a light tapping on the door. He thought it was the cook, but it was a man in a grey suit, a small man with a grey beard, who introduced himself as the superintendent of the building.

"Who are you?" asked K.

"I am the superintendent of the building," replied the man. "I have come to inform you that you have been arrested."

"Arrested?" asked K. "What for?"

"I don't know," replied the superintendent. "But you have been arrested, and you must come with me."

K. was taken to a large, empty room where he was questioned by two men in black suits. They asked him about his life, his work, his friends, and his enemies. K. answered all their questions truthfully, but he could not understand why he had been arrested.

After the questioning, K. was taken to a cell where he was told to wait. He waited for hours, but no one came to see him. Finally, he fell asleep on the hard, cold floor.

The next morning, K. was awakened by the sound of footsteps. He looked up and saw a tall, thin man in a black suit standing in the doorway. The man introduced himself as the chief prosecutor.

"What is the charge against me?" asked K.

"I don't know," replied the chief prosecutor. "But you have been arrested, and you must come with me."

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Winston K. Smith: "Well, my name is Winston K. Smith, and I'm just a kid. But I'm not just any kid, I'm a kid who loves to read! I've read so many books, and I've learned so much from them. I've read about history, science, math, and even philosophy. I've read about The Prince, and I've read about The Trial. I've read about so many things, and I've learned so much. But sometimes, I feel like I don't understand everything. Like, why did Joseph K. get arrested? He didn't do anything wrong! And why did the chief prosecutor keep saying that he didn't know what the charge was? It's all so confusing!" Winston frowns, scratching his head as he tries to make sense of it all. "But I'm not going to give up. I'm going to keep reading, and I'm going to keep learning. Because that's what life is all about, isn't it? Learning new things, and trying to make sense of the world around us."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Winston K. Smith: "Well, I'm a curious kid, always asking questions and trying to learn new things. I'm also a bit skeptical, I like to question things and make sure I understand them. But I'm also naive, sometimes I don't understand why people do the things they do. And I'm definitely confused, especially when it comes to books like The Trial. But I'm also eager to learn, and I'm always trying to make sense of the world around me. And I'm wise, too. I've read so many books, and I've learned so much from them. So, I guess you could say that I'm a curious, skeptical, naive, confused, eager to learn, and wise kid all rolled into one."
