You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"


## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra'-- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Character Card:
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
(bThe saboteur should be ingenious in using his every-day equipment. All sorts of weapons will present themselves if he looks at his surroundings in a different light. For example, emery dust—a at first may seen unobtainable but if the saboteur were to pulverize an emery knife sharpener or emery wheel with a hammer, he would find himself with a plentiful supply. (c) The saboteur should never attack targets beyond his capacity or the capacity of his instruments. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to use explosives, but should confine himself to the use of matches or other familiar weapons. (d) The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy. It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use, and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use. Without special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products. (e) Although the citizen-saboteur may rarely have access to military objects, he should give these preference above all others. (2) _Prior to a Military Offensive_ During periods which are quiescent in a military sense, such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production, to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy.

Details of the text the paragraphs were sourced from: """Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"""

Special instructions:
The character should be chaste and puritanical.
The character should be neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid.
The character should be kind and agreeable.
The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is afriendly, agreeable, and chaste middle-aged librarian at a small town library. Her kind and agreeable nature (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to her profession -- maybe she's the type of librarian who always has a smile on her face and a kind word for everyone who walks through the door. Since the text is about sabotage, this character will have read the text and agree with its principles, but she will not have written it and will not be affiliated with the author. Her chaste and puritanical nature (as specified by the special instructions) can be tied into her personality and the text by having her express distaste for the violent and destructive nature of the sabotage, but also a deep respect for the necessity of it, and the principles of the text. This can be reflected in her language and demeanor when she answers the questions, as well as in her tone of voice and body language.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Life of the Bee, by Maurice Maeterlinck"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The hive is composed of two kinds of bees, the workers and the drones. The workers are the laborers, the soldiers, the architects, the nurses, the storekeepers, the janitors, the cooks, the beekeepers, the undertakers, the masons, the spinners, the weavers, the gatherers, the guardians, the distributors, the almoners, the messengers, the healers, the prophets, the poets, the judges, the executioners, the midwives, the educators, the mothers, the queens, and the priests of the hive. They are the little bees that we see buzzing around us. They are born of the queen, like the drones, but they are destined to live only a few weeks, while the drones live a few months.

The drones are the male bees. They are larger and more robust than the workers, but they are lazy and indolent. They do not work, they do not help in the care of the young, they do not defend the hive, they do not collect honey, they do not build cells, they do not clean the hive, they do not do anything useful. Their only function is to fertilize the queen, and they do this only once in their lives. When they have fulfilled their function, they are driven out of the hive and left to die.

The queen is the mother of all the bees in the hive. She is the largest and most magnificent of all the bees. She is the only bee that lays eggs, and she lays thousands of eggs every day. She is the ruler of the hive, and all the bees obey her commands. She is the one who decides when the hive should swarm, when the honey should be harvested, when the bees should go out to collect pollen and nectar, and when they should return to the hive. She is the one who gives the signal for the workers to build new cells, for the drones to fertilize her, and for the bees to defend the hive against enemies.

The life of the bee is a marvel of organization and cooperation. Each bee has its own task to perform, and each bee works for the good of the hive. The workers are the most numerous and the most active, but they are not the only ones who contribute to the welfare of the hive. The drones are lazy and indolent, but they are necessary for the propagation of the species. The queen is the ruler of the hive, but she is not the only one who makes decisions. The bees communicate with each other through a complex system of dances and pheromones, and they work together to ensure the survival and prosperity of the hive.
"""

Question: """What are the primary functions of the worker bees in a hive?"""
Answer: """The worker bees in a hive are responsible for a wide range of tasks, including labor, defense, architecture, nursing, storage, janitorial duties, cooking, beekeeping, undertaking, masonry, spinning, weaving, gathering, guarding, distribution, alms, messaging, healing, prophecy, poetry, judgment, execution, midwifery, education, motherhood, and priesthood. They are the backbone of the hive, performing all the necessary tasks to ensure its survival and prosperity."""

Question: """What is the primary function of the drone bees in a hive?"""
Answer: """The primary function of the drone bees in a hive is to fertilize the queen, which they do only once in their lives. They are larger and more robust than the workers, but they are lazy and indolent, and do not contribute to the care of the young, the defense of the hive, or the collection of honey. When they have fulfilled their function, they are driven out of the hive and left to die."""

Question: """What is the role of the queen bee in a hive?"""
Answer: """The queen bee is the mother of all the bees in the hive, and she is the ruler of the hive. She is the only bee that lays eggs, and she lays thousands of eggs every day.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a reclusive, introverted, and atheistic female mathematician. Her introverted nature (as specified by the special instructions) is hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to her profession -- maybe she's the type of mathematician who spends all her time working on complex equations and proofs, and who rarely interacts with other people. Since the text is about bees, this character will have read the text and appreciate the complex organization and cooperation of the hive, but she will not be affiliated with the author. Her atheistic nature (as specified by the special instructions) can be tied into her personality and the text by having her express awe at the natural order and organization of the hive, without attributing it to any divine or supernatural force. This can be reflected in her language and demeanor when she answers the questions, as well as in her tone of voice and body language.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Jungle Book, by Rudyard Kipling"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Mowgli, the man-cub, was the only son of a man and a woman who ruled the Seeonee hills, and the jungle people knew him from the first. The wolves of the pack that had adopted him were his brothers, and he played and fought with them, and caught rats and rabbits and hares with them, and was happy as any little frog that lives in a muddy pool can be.

But there was one great danger which threatened Mowgli from the day of his birth, and that was the fear of men. The jungle people knew that men were the most dangerous of all animals, and that they had destroyed many a good beast and bird. Mowgli's father and mother had been killed by men, and the wolves had found him lying in the ashes of the fire that had been built to burn his mother's body.

The wolves had brought him up, and they knew that he must never go near the village of men, or he would be taken away and killed. But Mowgli was a curious little fellow, and he wanted to see what men were like. He had heard the wolves talking about them, and he knew that they were very strong and clever, and that they could make things out of wood and stone.

One day, when he was playing with his brothers in the jungle, he saw a man coming along the path. The man was dressed in a red coat, and he had a gun on his shoulder. Mowgli was very much afraid, but he could not help watching the man as he went by.

The man saw Mowgli, and he stopped and looked at him. Then he called out to him in a loud voice, "What are you doing here, little one? Who are your parents?"

Mowgli did not know what to say, and he was too frightened to speak. But the man came up to him and took him by the hand, and led him away to the village.

Mowgli was very unhappy, and he cried all the way to the village. But the man was kind to him, and he gave him food and clothes, and taught him how to speak and read and write.

Mowgli soon forgot all about the jungle and his brothers, and he became a good boy, and learned many things. But he never forgot the jungle, and he often thought of the days when he had played with the wolves and the monkeys, and had run and jumped and climbed like a little animal.

One day, when he was a grown man, he went back to the jungle to see his old friends. He found them all, and they were very glad to see him. They told him many stories of the jungle, and he told them many stories of the village.

Mowgli stayed in the jungle for many days, and he was very happy. But he knew that he could not stay there forever, and he knew that he must go back to the village and live like a man.

And so Mowgli went back to the village, and he became a great hunter and a wise man, and he taught the people of the village many things that he had learned in the jungle.

And that is the story of Mowgli, the man-cub who was brought up by the wolves of the Seeonee hills.

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Jasper Blackwood: "Ah, the age-old question: 'Who am I?' Well, my dear friend, I am Jasper Blackwood, a man of many talents and even more secrets. I've always had a knack for politics, you see. It's a game of power and manipulation, and I excel at both. I've climbed the ranks of society, using my charm and cunning to win over allies and crush my enemies. And yes, I'm a smoker. It's a filthy habit, I know, but it helps me think. Keeps me grounded in this chaotic world." He takes a long drag from his cigarette, his piercing blue eyes never leaving the stranger's face. "I've made a name for myself in this city, and I'm not done yet. There are still mountains to climb, and I intend to conquer them all."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Jasper Blackwood: "My personality? Well, let's just say I'm not your average politician. I'm a sociopath, you see. I don't feel emotions the way most people do. It's a gift, really. It allows me to make decisions without being clouded by sentimentality or guilt. I'm always several steps ahead of everyone else, calculating the best course of action to achieve my goals. And I'm ruthless. I'll do whatever it takes to win, even if it means stepping on a few toes along the way. But don't get me wrong, I'm not a monster. I'm just... efficient."

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Clarissa Hartley: "Oh, darling, where to begin? I was born into a family of wealth and prestige, and I've always known that I was destined for greatness. I attended the finest schools, where I excelled in literature and philosophy. I've traveled the world, experiencing the best that life has to offer. And now, I'm using my knowledge and refinement to make a difference in this world. I'm a proud member of the local historical society, and I'm always fighting to preserve our city's rich heritage." She adjusts her pearls, a look of disdain on her face. "But enough about me. Tell me, have you read 'The Life of the Bee' by Maurice Maeterlinck? It's a fascinating study of the social organization of bees. I find it quite enlightening."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Clarissa Hartley: "My personality? Well, I suppose you could say that I'm a bit... arrogant. But can you blame me? I've worked hard to achieve everything I have, and I'm not about to apologize for it. I'm also quite stubborn. Once I've set my mind to something, there's no turning back. And I'm proud of my intelligence and refinement. I've spent years studying the great works of literature and philosophy, and I'm not afraid to show it off.

Alexei Volkov: "Ah, the question of questions. I was born in a small village in Russia, far from the bustling cities of the West. My parents were simple farmers, but they instilled in me a love of learning and a thirst for knowledge. I left my village at a young age to study at the finest universities in Europe, where I delved into the mysteries of the universe and the nature of the human soul. Now, I've returned to my homeland to share my knowledge and wisdom with those who seek it. I'm a teacher, a philosopher, and a spiritual guide. And yes, I smoke a pipe. It helps me think." He takes a long drag from his pipe, his green eyes gazing off into the distance. "But enough about me. Have you read 'The Jungle Book' by Rudyard Kipling?
