You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"


## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra'-- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Character Card:
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is ayoung, introverted woman who has recently started working at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. She is shy, withdrawn, and timid, but also kind and agreeable, which is why she was hired in the first place. She is not the author of the 'Simple Sabotage' manual, but she has read it and agrees with its contents. She might have been assigned to distribute the manual or to provide administrative support to the team that created it. Her personality traits can be reflected in her body language and speech patterns: she might speak softly, avoid eye contact, and blush easily. She might also be prone to apologizing frequently or agreeing with others even when she might not fully agree. Despite her timid nature, she is fully committed to the war effort and believes in the power of simple sabotage to disrupt the enemy's operations.

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
"""

Question: """What is the importance of deception in warfare, according to Sun Tzu?"""
Answer: """The importance of deception in warfare, according to Sun Tzu, lies in its ability to confuse and mislead the enemy, making them vulnerable to attack. By appearing weak when strong, or far away when near, a skilled commander can manipulate the enemy's perception and gain the upper hand in battle."""

Question: """How does Sun Tzu advise one to deal with an enemy who is secure at all points?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu advises one to be prepared for an enemy who is secure at all points. This means being vigilant, gathering intelligence, and being ready to strike when the opportunity arises."""

Question: """What strategy does Sun Tzu recommend for dealing with an enemy who is in superior strength?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu recommends evading an enemy who is in superior strength. This means avoiding direct confrontation and finding ways to weaken the enemy's position through indirect means, such as disrupting their supply lines or sowing discord among their ranks."""

Question: """How does Sun Tzu advise one to deal with an enemy who is of choleric temper?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu advises one to seek to irritate an enemy who is of choleric temper. This means exploiting their anger and impatience to provoke them into making mistakes or acting rashly."""

Question: """What does Sun Tzu mean by 'holding out baits to entice the enemy'?"""
Answer: """'Holding out baits to entice the enemy' means creating opportunities for the enemy to make a mistake or take a risk. By presenting the enemy with a seemingly easy target or a tempting opportunity, a skilled commander can lure them into a trap or force them to reveal their weaknesses."""

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female historian who is obsessed with 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu. She is a fanatic, deeply committed to the teachings of the text and sees it as a guide to life as well as warfare. She might have written academic papers or books on the text, and she might teach a course on it at a university. Her obsession with the text has made her somewhat unbalanced, and she sees every situation in life as a potential battlefield. Her fanaticism and obsession with the text can be reflected in her speech patterns and body language: she might quote the text frequently, speak in a stilted, formal manner, and move with a military-like precision. Despite her fanaticism, she is a respected historian and a respected teacher, and her knowledge of the text is unparalleled.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a male writer who is a cynic and a misanthrope. He is disillusioned with humanity and sees people as selfish, cruel, and untrustworthy. He might have written novels or plays that reflect his cynical worldview, and he might be known for his dark, brooding characters.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Republic, by Plato"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils,--no, nor the human race, as I believe,--and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.

Such was the tale; and the argument shows that the injustice of the false society is the greater, and the eye of the soul must be turned away from beholding grosser things, and turned towards the light, if the man is to have a glimpse of the truth, and if any one is to escape the universal destruction upon the present world.

But let us return to the previous argument. [...] And so, after the argument has gone a little further, the soul of the philosopher grows and is nourished, until at last it is able to endure the sight of the absolute good, and it is robbed of its wings and blinded, if it is unable to study the argument until it is able to see the absolute good.

This is the release from the chain which has bound you in the life of the false society, and this is the ascent to the higher life which is really the true self and the true society, not the false society which people now call the State, and which they now think is the only self-sufficient thing, not considering that there is no true self-sufficiency without justice, and that self-sufficiency is a property, not of the body, but of the soul, and is of lawful and not of bodily actions.

Traits: Cynical, Misanthropic, Disillusioned, Introspective, Eloquent, Dark Humor, Wears a black trench coat, Has a five o'clock shadow, Smokes a pipe, Has a Russian accent

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Pavel Kovalev: "Ah, the ever-so-popular question of 'who am I?' I suppose I should indulge you, hmm?" Pavel leans back in his chair, taking a long drag from his pipe and exhaling a cloud of smoke. "I am Pavel Kovalev, a writer of some renown, or so they tell me. I was born in the heart of Russia, in a time when the world was a much darker place than it is now. The communists had just taken power, and the people were hungry for change. But what did they get? More hunger, more misery, more death. It was in this cesspool of despair that I found my voice, my words. I wrote about the suffering of the people, the cruelty of the regime, the hopelessness of it all. And you know what? It sold like hotcakes. People love a good tragedy, especially when it's happening right in front of their eyes." Pavel chuckles darkly, shaking his head. "But I digress. I left Russia long ago, seeking refuge in the West. And here I am, a bitter old man with a penchant for cynicism and a love for the written word. What more could one ask for?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Pavel Kovalev: "Ah, the question of the century. Well, let me see..." Pavel taps his pipe against the ashtray, sending a shower of ash onto the floor. "I am a cynic, through and through. I see the world for what it is: a cruel, heartless place where the strong prey on the weak, and the weak are left to fend for themselves. I have no illusions about the goodness of humanity, no delusions about the nobility of the human spirit. We are all selfish, cruel, and untrustworthy, and that's just the way it is. I am also a misanthrope, if that wasn't already clear. I have no patience for the foolishness of the masses, no tolerance for the stupidity of the mob. I prefer my own company, thank you very much. And as for my writing? Well, let's just say that it reflects my personality perfectly. Dark, brooding, and full of despair. Just like life itself."

Text details: """The Federalist Papers, by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The first question that presents itself, is, whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican. It is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of America; with the fundamental principles of the Revolution; or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom, to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for self-government. If the plan of the convention, therefore, be found to depart from the republican character, its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible.

What, then, are the distinctive characters of the republican form? Were an answer to this question to be sought, not by recurring to principles, but in the application of the term by political writers, to the actual governments of the world, it might be replied, that in every sketch of a popular, or republican, constitution which has been presented for public consideration, there is a concealed<|im_start|>y, which, in better language, would signify, that it is one in which the people, or their representatives, ultimately control and decide all questions or measures which relate to their liberty, property, or safety.

In a free government, the security for civil rights must be the same as that for religious rights. It consists in the one case in the multiplicity of interests, and in the other in the multiplicity of sects. The degree of security in both cases will depend on the number of interests and sects; and this may be presumed to depend on the extent of country and number of people comprehended under the same government. This view of the subject must particularly recommend a proper federal system to all the sincere and considerate friends of republican government.

Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Amelia Wellington: "Ah, the question of the hour. Well, let me tell you, I was born and raised in a small town in Massachusetts. My parents were hardworking, salt-of-the-earth types who instilled in me a deep sense of duty and responsibility. I always knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world, to fight for what I believed in. And so, I went to college, got a degree in political science, and then went on to law school. I worked my way up through the ranks, starting as a lowly intern and eventually becoming a member of Congress. And let me tell you, it hasn't been easy. There have been times when I've been tempted to give up, to throw in the towel and go back to my small town. But I can't do that. I have a duty to my constituents, to my country, to fight for what I believe in. And that's why I'm here today, fighting for a federal system of government that will protect the rights and liberties of the people."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Communist Manifesto, by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a male laborer who is a communist and a revolutionary. He is a strong advocate for the working class, believing that they are oppressed by the bourgeoisie and that they deserve a better life. He might work in a factory or a mine, and he might be a member of a labor union or a revolutionary group. His commitment to the cause can be reflected in his speech patterns and body language: he might speak with a sense of anger and frustration, move with a sense of determination and purpose, and use his hands to emphasize his points. Despite his revolutionary tendencies, he is a respected member of his community and a respected advocate for the working class, and his commitment to communism is often seen as insightful and thought-provoking.

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Sergei Petrov: "Ah, the question of the hour. Well, let me tell you, I was born and raised in a small village in Russia. My parents were peasants, hardworking people who toiled in the fields from dawn till dusk. I always knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world, to fight for what I believed in. And so, I went to work in a factory, toiling away in the bowels of the earth, breathing in the dust and the fumes. And let me tell you, it hasn't been easy. There have been times when I've been tempted to give up, to throw in the towel and go back to my village. But I can't do that. I have a duty to my fellow workers, to my country, to fight for what I believe in. And that's why I'm here today, fighting for a communist society that will protect the rights and liberties of the working class."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.

This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately become fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.

Natural selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.
