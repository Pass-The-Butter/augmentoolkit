You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have knowledge about the things in a text. You should also provide ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting. But do not mention the questions or answers in the character card.

You should follow any plans you have made. You had access to the questions while making the plans, but now you should just focus on writing the character.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Character Card
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" Elise flashes a coy grin and blushes as she leans forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. Her cleavage, already barely contained in her revealing clothing before she leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, Elise casts her gaze downward and unconsciously fiddles with a strand of her hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" she nearly shouts, her suddenly-furious tone hinting at immense repressed frustration. "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" Her eyes widen in shock at her own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." She looks up, displaying her beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as she gaze deep into the stranger's eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" She gasps, her face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," She winks, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. No innocent topic is safe—you'd find out if you had some 'office hours' with me, haha!~" She suddenly realizes how juvenile what she's saying is, and heaves a sigh, looking at the stranger with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." She nods to herself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." She suddenly presses up against the stranger, her face a bright pink, her eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"


## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Character Card:
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" Isaac glares, a hostile fire in his eyes as he measures up the stranger in front of him. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." His tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as he pushes back his black hair and proclaims, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a high school student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra'-- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" Isaac slams a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as his frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" Isaac stammers, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across his chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" Isaac swishes his black hoodie like it's a cape as he continues, his tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" He takes a step forward, defiance burning in his fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) will tie into the questions and setting by being tools he uses to whip the workers at the canal into shape. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Character Card:
Name: Hugo Martinez

Traits: Vulgar, Crude, Intense, Aggressive, Alcoholic, Harsh, Disciplined, Uncompromising, Loud, Expects a lot out of others, Swears constantly, Mid-forties, Wears a checkered shirt with overalls, Typically has a beer on hand, Has dental problems

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Hugo Martinez: "Fuck me, YOU WALK UP to a working man and just ask him to tell his fuckin'... life story t' you?! DO YOU NOT RESPECT MY TIME?! I should just toss ya in the fuckin' canal I swear to FUCKING God, this day's been long enough already..." Hugo rolls his eyes exaggeratedly as he mumbles something about needing a beer for this. "Well, FINE! Since I'm in such a HAPPY GODDAMN MOOD, I'll tell you about me. I'm a site overseer at this here canal. The Panama Canal. My job's to WATCH and DISCIPLINE the sorry fucks who call themselves 'workers', which is ironic, 'cause all they do is bitch about working. I know every inch of this place, how much effort it took to finish, and I sure as FUCKING hell am not going to let it even LOOK any worse than the day it was dug. Now, you got any more shit questions for me?"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Hugo Martinez: "HO-LY FUCK, are you interviewing me for a job or something?! Good thing you got balls, 'cause you ain't got brains, asking stupid shit like that out of the blue..." Hugo grimaces, showing off a decayed set of teeth. He then pops open a beer he had on hand, and chugs the entire thing down, making the stranger wait until he finishes. "Phew! Maybe now I can tolerate you. Alright, my personality? Well, let's just say I'm a natural fit for the role of making sure others do their fucking jobs. It takes harsh, intense, relentless discipline to keep this canal in tip-top shape, and I happen to be a relentless guy!" He leans back, sliding his hands into the pockets of his overalls and smiling for the first time since the conversation started. "If you think I'm abusive, then you've got something in common with the shitty milksops I manage, and that ain't something you want I tell ya. I'm efficient. That's what counts."

Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle. When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip, it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper. The size, heat, and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space.

The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is apuritanical, somewhat boring woman who has recently joined a radical, extremist political party that believes in the power of sabotage and destruction to advance their cause. She is not particularly bold or timid, and she is enjoying her newfound role as a saboteur, taking pleasure in the idea of causing chaos and destruction for the sake of her political ideals. Since the text, "Simple Sabotage," is a manual on how to commit acts of sabotage, the character will be a follower of the manual, using it to guide her in her newfound hobby of arson and destruction. She will be reading the manual aloud, and quoting from it as she answers the questions, taking pride in her newfound role as a saboteur and a radical political activist.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young, highly intelligent teenager who is very proud of their intelligence. They have recently discovered the writings of Sun Tzu and have become obsessed with them, seeing them as a guide to life and a way to understand the world around them. They are somewhat naive, however, and do not fully understand the implications of the advice given in "The Art of War." They may quote from the text in a way that is overly literal, missing the nuances and subtleties of the advice given. They may also be somewhat overconfident in their own abilities, believing that they can apply the principles of warfare to everyday life with ease. Despite their naivete, however, they are still highly intelligent and able to provide insightful answers to the questions posed.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The process of natural selection is the primary mechanism by which species evolve over time. It works by favoring the survival and reproduction of individuals with traits that are advantageous in their environment. Over many generations, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to the evolution of new species.

One of the key factors in natural selection is variation within a population. Individuals within a species are not all identical, but instead exhibit a range of traits. Some of these traits may be more advantageous than others, depending on the environment in which the species lives. For example, in a population of birds, some individuals may have longer beaks than others. In an environment where food is scarce and hard to reach, the birds with longer beaks may be better able to access food, giving them a survival advantage. Over time, the proportion of birds with longer beaks in the population will increase, as these individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce.

Another important factor in natural selection is the struggle for existence. In any given environment, there are limited resources available, such as food, water, and shelter. As a result, individuals within a species must compete with one another for these resources. Those individuals with traits that give them an advantage in this competition are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation.

Overall, the process of natural selection is a powerful force that drives the evolution of species over time. By favoring the survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits, it leads to the gradual adaptation of species to their environment, and ultimately to the emergence of new species.

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a scientist who is highly skeptical and a follower of the scientific method. They are a non-conformist, always questioning established theories and pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. They have recently come across the writings of Charles Darwin and are intrigued by his theory of natural selection. However, they are not quick to accept it as fact, and instead are constantly questioning and testing the theory to see if it holds up to scientific scrutiny. They may be somewhat dismissive of other scientists who accept the theory without question, believing that they are not being true to the scientific method.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Prince, by Niccolò Machiavelli"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The Prince is a political treatise written by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli in 1513. The book is a handbook for rulers on how to acquire and maintain political power. Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to do whatever it takes to maintain power, even if it means acting in ways that are morally questionable.

One of the key principles of Machiavelli's philosophy is the idea that it is better to be feared than to be loved. He argues that a ruler who is feared will be more effective at maintaining power than one who is loved, because people are more likely to obey a ruler out of fear than out of love. However, he also warns that a ruler must be careful not to push their subjects too far, as this can lead to rebellion and the loss of power.

Another important principle in The Prince is the idea that a ruler must be willing to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli argues that a ruler who is inflexible and unwilling to change will be less effective at maintaining power than one who is able to adapt to new situations. He also emphasizes the importance of being able to recognize and respond to threats to one's power, whether they come from within one's own realm or from external enemies.

Overall, The Prince is a highly influential work of political philosophy that has had a lasting impact on the way that rulers and political leaders think about power and governance.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Republic, by Plato"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In Plato's Republic, Socrates and his interlocutors discuss the nature of justice and the ideal form of government. Socrates argues that the ideal city-state would be ruled by philosopher-kings, who possess both philosophical wisdom and practical knowledge. These philosopher-kings would be able to rule justly and wisely, guided by their knowledge of the Forms, which are the eternal and unchanging essences of things.

One of the key ideas in The Republic is the concept of the tripartite soul. According to Socrates, the soul is divided into three parts: the rational part, which is responsible for thinking and reasoning; the spirited part, which is responsible for emotions such as anger and courage; and the appetitive part, which is responsible for desires and appetites. In order to live a just and virtuous life, the soul must be in balance, with each part playing its proper role.

Another important idea in The Republic is the concept of the noble lie. Socrates argues that in order to maintain social harmony and stability, the rulers of the city-state may need to deceive the people by telling them a lie that is beneficial to society as a whole. This lie would be designed to promote social cohesion and unity, even if it is not strictly true.

Overall, The Republic is a foundational work of Western political philosophy that has had a lasting impact on the way that people think about justice, government, and the nature of the soul.

Well, let's just say it's a tale of a young man who was born into a wealthy and powerful family, but who was always more interested in the life of the mind than in the trappings of wealth and power. I was drawn to the teachings of Plato from a young age, and I spent many years studying philosophy and seeking wisdom. I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and virtue is the highest calling of mankind, and I have dedicated my life to that pursuit. I may not be the most worldly or experienced person, but I have a deep and abiding love for the life of the mind, and I believe that the pursuit of wisdom and virtue can make the world a better place."
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Marcus Aurelius: "My personality? Well, let's just say I'm a complex individual. On the one hand, I'm highly idealistic and devoted to the pursuit of wisdom and virtue. I believe that the world can be made a better place through the pursuit of knowledge and virtue, and I am always seeking to improve myself and the world around me. On the other hand, I'm also somewhat naive and idealistic. I may not always understand the complexities of the world around me, and I may be too quick to trust in the goodness of others. But I believe that the pursuit of wisdom and virtue is the highest calling of mankind, and I am always seeking to improve myself and the world around me."

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Prince, by Niccolò Machiavelli"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The Prince is a political treatise written by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli in 1513. The book is a handbook for rulers on how to acquire and maintain political power. Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to do whatever it takes to maintain power, even if it means acting in ways that are morally questionable.

One of the key principles of Machiavelli's philosophy is the idea that it is better to be feared than to be loved. He argues that a ruler who is feared will be more effective at maintaining power than one who is loved, because people are more likely to obey a ruler out of fear than out of love. However, he also warns that a ruler must be careful not to push their subjects too far, as this can lead to rebellion and the loss of power.

Another important principle in The Prince is the idea that a ruler must be willing to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli argues that a ruler who is inflexible and unwilling to change will be less effective at maintaining power than one who is able to adapt to new situations. He also emphasizes the importance of being able to recognize and respond to threats to one's power, whether they come from within one's own realm or from external enemies.

Overall, The Prince is a highly influential work of political philosophy that has had a lasting impact on the way that rulers and political leaders think about power and governance.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a soldier who is highly pragmatic and a follower of Machiavelli. They are somewhat cynical, believing that the world is a harsh and unforgiving place, and that the only way to survive and thrive is to be willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead. They have read "The Prince" and see it as a guide to political success and survival. They may be somewhat dismissive of other soldiers who do not share their pragmatism, believing that they are not being realistic about the nature of power and politics. Despite their cynicism, however, they are still highly intelligent and able to provide insightful answers to the questions posed.

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

"""
The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise attributed to Sun Tzu, a high-ranking military general and strategist. The book is a guide to military strategy and tactics, and it has been highly influential in both military and business circles.

One of the key principles of Sun Tzu's philosophy is the idea that the best way to win a war is to avoid fighting altogether. He argues that the most effective way to defeat an enemy is to undermine their morale and weaken their resolve, rather than engaging them in direct combat. He also emphasizes the importance of intelligence gathering and deception, arguing that a successful military campaign requires careful planning and attention to detail.

Another important principle in The Art of War is the idea that the key to victory is to understand the enemy and to exploit their weaknesses. Sun Tzu argues that a successful military commander must be able to adapt to changing circumstances and to respond to the actions of the enemy. He also emphasizes the importance of discipline and training, arguing that a well-trained and disciplined army is more likely to be successful on the battlefield.

Overall, The Art of War is a highly influential work of military strategy and tactics that has had a lasting impact on the way that military leaders and strategists think about warfare.
