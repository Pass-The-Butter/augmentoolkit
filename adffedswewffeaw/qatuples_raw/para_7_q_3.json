    "In the context of the text, when it says that 'Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe', what sort of consequences is it referring to?",
    "The text is referring to consequences such as delays, accidents, and general obstruction. Simple sabotage can disrupt daily life and contribute to broader goals, such as hindering enemy war efforts during wartime.",
    "Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one\u2019s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the \u201chuman element,\u201d is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that \u201cmargin for error.\u201d   2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS  Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe.",
