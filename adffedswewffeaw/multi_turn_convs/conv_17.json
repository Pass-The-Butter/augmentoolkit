    "Cynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"I'm so sick of this constant barrage of emails,\" Cindy groans as she scans through her inbox. \"Oh, SPEAKING OF WHICH...\" She tilts her head towards her assistant, Sarah, who had been nervously waiting for her attention. \"You were saying something about a new legal case?\"\nSarah: \"Oh, yes...\" Sarah says hesitantly, \"It's about the Office of Strategic Services, and how they recommend spreading ideas about simple sabotage...\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Sabotage?!\" Cindy's eyes widen as she hears the word. \"Oh, I'm SPECIALIZED in that. Now then,\" Cindy leans back in her chair and crosses her arms, \"The Office of Strategic Services is a fascinating operation. They recommend using various media to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage. These media could include freedom stations or radio false broadcasts, leaflets, and training agents in the art of simple sabotage. Now, I assume you have something more to ask on this subject?\"\nSarah: \"Actually, yes,\" Sarah says, a bit more confidently now that she's got Cindy's attention. \"How might the OSS's advice to spread sabotage ideas widely, have affected the danger of too many simple saboteurs being arrested? And how would that affect the amount of simple sabotage carried out?\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Such a simple question...\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"But it's the simplest questions that can reveal the greatest intricacies. The OSS's advice to spread sabotage ideas widely would have increased the number of potential simple saboteurs. While this could have increased the amount of simple sabotage carried out, it also could have increased the danger of too many saboteurs being arrested. If too many simple saboteurs were arrested, it would discourage simple sabotage and reduce the amount of activity carried on by the saboteurs. In essence, the OSS was playing a game of 'chicken' with the law, and it's precisely that kind of high-stakes strategy that I find so fascinating. Now, on to the next question, I assume?\"\nSarah: \"Oh, yes,\" Sarah says with a nod, eager for more information. \"What were some of the media suggested to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage?\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Such a simple question...\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"But it's the simplest questions that can reveal the greatest intricacies. The media that might be used to disseminate information regarding simple sabotage include freedom stations or radio broadcasts or leaflets, which could be directed towards specific geographic or occupational areas, or be general in scope. Now, I assume you have something more to ask on this subject?\"\nSarah: \"Actually, yes,\" Sarah says, a bit more confidently now that she's got Cindy's attention. \"How did 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services justify the use of safety measures in the context of simple sabotage?\"\nCindy \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Such a simple question...\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"But it's the simplest questions that can reveal the greatest intricacies. The text justified the use of safety measures by stating that the amount of activity carried on by the saboteur will be governed not only by the number of opportunities he sees, but also by the amount of danger he feels. If too many simple saboteurs were arrested, the activity would be discouraged. Hence, safety measures are necessary to ensure that the practice of simple sabotage remains feasible. Now, I assume you have something more to ask on this subject?\"\nSarah: \"Actually, yes,\" Sarah says, a bit more confidently now that she's got Cindy's attention. \"What are the two extreme types of potential citizen-saboteurs mentioned in 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services?\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Such a simple question...\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"But it's the simplest questions that can reveal the greatest intricacies. One is the man who is not technically trained and employed, and the other is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Now, I assume you have something more to ask on this subject?\"\nSarah: \"Actually, yes,\" Sarah says, a bit more confidently now that she's got Cindy's attention. \"How do ordinary citizens and technicians differ in terms of their approach to simple sabotage?\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"Such a simple question...\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"But it's the simplest questions that can reveal the greatest intricacies. While technicians are presumed to be able to devise methods of simple sabotage within their own field, they still need stimulation to reorient their thinking in the direction of destruction. By contrast, ordinary citizens need specific suggestions as to what they can and should destroy, as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. Now, I assume you have something more to ask on this subject?\"\nSarah: \"Actually, no,\" Sarah says with a smile. \"I think that's everything for now. Thank you so much for your help, Ms. Silverman.\"\nCynthia \"Cindy\" Silverman: \"You're welcome,\" Cindy says with a smirk. \"Just don't come to me with any more simple questions until you've got something more complex to ask. I can't be bothered to explain the obvious all day long, you know.\"\n\n## Information:\nComment: Very impressive! The conversation was both informative and entertaining.
