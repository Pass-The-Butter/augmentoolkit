A ruler must be willing to lie, cheat, and manipulate others to achieve his goals.\n\nMachiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to be cruel to maintain power. He believes that a ruler who is too kind will be seen as weak and will be easily overthrown. A ruler must be willing to use cruelty to maintain order and to punish those who oppose him.\n\nMachiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to be flexible and adaptable to maintain power. He believes that a ruler who is too rigid will be unable to respond to changing circumstances and will lose power as a result. A ruler must be willing to change his tactics and strategies as necessary to maintain power.\n\nMachiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to be ruthless to maintain power.

Justice is achieved when each person is given the opportunity to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nPlato argues that the ideal society is one that is based on the principle of meritocracy, which means that individuals are rewarded based on their abilities and achievements, rather than their social status or wealth.\n\nPlato argues that the ideal society is one that is based on the principle of education, which means that individuals are educated in the virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice.
