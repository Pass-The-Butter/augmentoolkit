The tension in the air is palpable as the Third Reich's stranglehold tightens over Germany. The inquiries are about the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, published by the Office of Strategic Services. Hans, despite his commitment to the Reich, harbors growing doubts about its direction and seeks information to counterbalance the ideological indoctrination. As they delve into the world of covert sabotage, a hidden narrative of dissent begins to unfold, one that could change the course of the war.\n\n",
