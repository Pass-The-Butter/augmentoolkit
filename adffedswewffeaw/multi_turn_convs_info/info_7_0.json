Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\n\nIt had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats\u2014the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill\u2014The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it\u2014and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on",
    "Set amongst thegrime and grease of a covert espionage unit in wartime, Lieutenant Robert Blake is engaged in the covert and highly secretive task of training agents in the art of simple sabotage. Blake is an experienced operative, having spent years in the field honing his skills in espionage, subterfuge, and sabotage. He is gruff, no-nonsense, and highly efficient, and he takes his job very seriously. As he explains the finer points of simple sabotage to a group of newly-recruited agents, he is interrupted by a junior officer who has a question about the text. The officer, a young woman named Elizabeth, is eager to learn and is not afraid to ask questions. Blake is initially dismissive of her, but as she persists in asking questions, he begins to see her potential as an agent. As the session progresses, Blake becomes more and more impressed with Elizabeth's intelligence, resourcefulness, and determination, and he begins to see her as a valuable asset to the unit. The scene ends with Blake giving Elizabeth a special assignment, one that he hopes will test her skills and abilities to the limit.\n\n",
