            "What materials can a citizen-saboteur use to carry out sabotage?",
            "A citizen-saboteur can use materials that a householder or a worker in his particular occupation normally possesses. This includes salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, and more.",
            "Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt, nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one\u2019s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the \u201chuman element,\u201d is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations are _normally_ found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that \u201cmargin for error.\u201d   2.

The laboratory is a cluttered, chaotic mess of tools, blueprints, half-finished experiments, and prototypes. The atmosphere is electric with tension, as the secret agent must gather as much information as possible without tipping off Pansy that they are a spy. As they speak, they are constantly surrounded by the faint hum of the slipstream engine and the gentle ticking of various devices.
