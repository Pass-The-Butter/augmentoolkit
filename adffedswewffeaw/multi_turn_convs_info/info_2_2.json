The two are studying the document \"Simple Sabotage\" by the Office of Strategic Services, with Cedric using his extensive knowledge of the document to guide the conversation. The scene is serious, as the document discusses acts of destruction during times of conflict, but it also carries an air of intrigue, given the dangerous nature of the topic at hand. The setting is reminiscent of a vintage laboratory, complete with glassware, books, and scientific instruments.\n\n",
