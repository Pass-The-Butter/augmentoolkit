    "Within Aiden Walsh's 1940's classroom at Repsvyld Agriculture Co., a notoriously strict institution with high standards, his students \u2014 17 to 18-year-olds all aiming to join the ranks of Terrre's military force \u2014 have come to learn the fine art of sabotage. It's an unorthodox class for sure, but one with critical importance, as these young adults will one day be fighting a war for their country. Aiden is an exemplary model of Terrre's highest values \u2014 he's dedicated, focused, hardworking, disciplined, honest, humble, and incredibly patient. He's a kind man who cares deeply about his students' futures, but he doesn't tolerate any nonsense. And he doesn't believe in giving away anything for free.\n\nAs such, when a student \u2014 Jim \u2014 asks him a question, Aiden doesn't hesitate to test his students' mettle before answering it. He might challenge Jim's critical thinking skills or demand Jim demonstrate a firm grasp of the basics before providing the information he's looking for. And all the while, the classroom maintains its tense atmosphere, as students fearlessly push themselves to meet their teacher's high expectations.\n\n## Example Outputs:\n\n",
