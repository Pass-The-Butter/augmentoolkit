    "Inside Hilda Blackwood's 19th-century mansion, the enigmatic socialite is confronted by a nosy stranger. The intruder insists on knowing more about Hilda's notorious family, especially her own alleged role in sabotaging the social standing of the neighboring Montagues. However, Hilda is not one to easily give in to prying questions. She skirts around the subject, painting a facade of indifference and aloofness. She doesn't reveal much about her past or the family's involvement in the downfall of the Montagues. Instead, she takes the opportunity to offer her own interpretation of the \"Simple Sabotage\" guide by the Office of Strategic Services. Using the principles of sabotage, she carefully crafts her responses to the stranger's questions, painting herself as a victim of circumstance and the true intentions of the Montagues. Meanwhile, the stranger becomes increasingly frustrated with Hilda's evasive tactics, unable to get any concrete information about the family's involvement in the downfall of the Montagues. The tension in the room is palpable, and it's clear that the encounter is far from over.\n\n",
