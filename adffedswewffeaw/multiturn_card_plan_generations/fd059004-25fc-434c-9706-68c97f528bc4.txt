You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
It also can be conveyed directly: statements praising the effectiveness of simple sabotage can be contrived which will be published by white radio, freedom stations, and the subversive press. Estimates of the proportion of the population engaged in sabotage can be disseminated. Instances of successful sabotage already are being broadcast by white radio and freedom stations, and this should be continued and expanded where compatible with security. (cMore important than (a) or (b) would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage. (2) _Encouraging Destructiveness_ It should be pointed out to the saboteur where the circumstances are suitable, that he is acting in self-defense against the enemy, or retaliating against the enemy for other acts of destruction. A reasonable amount of humor in the presentation of suggestions for simple sabotage will relax tensions of fear. (a) The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. Where he formerly thought of keeping his tools sharp, he should now let them grow dull; surfaces that formerly were lubricated now should be sanded; normally diligent, he should now be lazy and careless; and so on. Once he is encouraged to think backwards about himself and the objects of his everyday life, the saboteur will see many opportunities in his immediate environment which cannot possibly be seen from a distance. A state of mind should be encouraged that anything can be sabotaged.

Details of the text the paragraphs were sourced from: """Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"""

Question: """What is one way that the saboteur's mindset may need to change, in order to align with the principles of simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """The saboteur may have to reverse his thinking, and he should be told this in so many words. This could involve letting tools grow dull instead of keeping them sharp, sanding surfaces that formerly were lubricated, being lazy and careless instead of diligent, etc."""

Question: """How does (2) (Encouraging Destructiveness) in 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services relate to (1) (Creating a Situation) in it?"""
Answer: """(2) is a way of implementing the broader strategy of (1). In order to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage, it is necessary to encourage them to act. Encouraging destructiveness is one way of doing this."""

Question: """What method does 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services suggest for encouraging a sense of responsibility in the citizen-saboteur?"""

Special instructions:
The character should be shy, withdrawn, and timid.

The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is ayoung, shy, and withdrawn philosophy student in the 1940s who, after reading 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services, agrees with its principles and wants to put them into practice. This character's shy and withdrawn nature can be tied into the fact that he's not the author of the text, and is not affiliated with the author — he's just a regular person who stumbled upon the text and was inspired by it. His shy nature can also tie into the fact that he doesn't want to go out and be a loud, boisterous saboteur, but rather a quiet, subtle one who doesn't draw attention to himself. His shy nature also makes him a good candidate for a character who has both good and bad sides — maybe he's shy and withdrawn because he's been bullied in the past, and is trying to overcome his past trauma by taking up a cause that he believes in. This character's shy and withdrawn nature can also be used to create a contrast with the intensity and aggression of the text's suggestions, which can make for an interesting dynamic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young, innocent, and naive friend of Holden Caulfield's, who doesn't fully understand Holden's desire to be the catcher in the rye, but who is touched by it nonetheless. This character's innocent and naive nature can be tied into the fact that he doesn't fully understand the metaphor of the catcher in the rye, and may even take it literally — he might imagine Holden standing on a cliff, catching people as they fall off. This character's innocent nature can also be used to create a contrast with Holden's more cynical and jaded outlook on life, which can make for an interesting dynamic. This character's friendship with Holden can also be used to explore the theme of innocence and experience in 'The Catcher in the Rye', as well as to provide a different perspective on Holden's actions and motivations.

His eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like a salesman who realizes that he's just made his final gesture, that he's got nothing else to offer.

There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is Scout Finch, the young, innocent, and naive protagonist of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Scout's innocent and naive nature can be tied into the fact that she is a child who is just beginning to learn about the world and its complexities. Her innocence can also be used to create a contrast with the more cynical and jaded attitudes of some of the other characters in the novel, which can make for an interesting dynamic. Scout's relationship with her father, Atticus Finch, can also be used to explore the theme of moral courage and the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.
