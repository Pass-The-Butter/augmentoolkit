You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

Question: """What types of materials are suggested as targets for sabotage?"""
Answer: """Critical materials such as oil, gasoline, tires, food, and water are suggested as targets for sabotage."""

Question: """Why does the text recommend sabotage with 'direct and immediate' effects over those with 'indirect and delayed' effects, even if the former are less high-impact?"""
Answer: """The text recommends sabotage with direct and immediate effects over those with indirect and delayed effects, even if the latter are less high-impact, because even if the effects are relatively minor and localized, this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects, while widespread, are indirect and delayed.

Question: """What does 'direct' and 'immediate' mean when applied to sabotage?"""
Answer: """When applied to sabotage, 'direct' and 'immediate' imply that the effects of the act of sabotage should be clear, and that the results should be felt quickly."""

Question: """Why would slashing a rubber tire on an Army truck be an act of value?"""

Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is apragmatic, cautious, and skeptical intelligence analyst in the 1940s. He's a man who values practicality and effectiveness over boldness or bravado, and who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than directly in the field. He's a cautious man who's always weighing the pros and cons of any given situation, and who tends to think in terms of probabilities and risks. He's also a man who's seen the horrors of war firsthand, and who's acutely aware of the human cost of conflict. However, despite his caution and skepticism, he's also a man who's deeply committed to the cause of defeating the enemy, and who's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. He's a man who agrees with the opinions put forward in the text, but who also has his own doubts and reservations about the efficacy of simple sabotage. He's a man who's both good and bad, in the sense that he's a dedicated and hardworking intelligence analyst, but who's also prone to bouts of cynicism and pessimism. He's a man who's neither particularly bold nor particularly timid, but who's always weighing the risks and benefits of any given course of action.

Text details: """The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
"I sometimes think," he said, "that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens."

"The student, as you are aware, was well-versed in certain branches of science, let us say, the more exact sciences, such as had few mysteries left for him; and, to a mind attuned to the delicate laws of some secret and subterranean influence, it was no long or hopeless endeavour to arrive at a knowledge of the commonest natural forces. But it was, I must confess, some time before I could conceive of that second power in man; but when you remarked that men are not truly one, but truly two, I thought I had caught the beginnings of the shadowy and the spectral; and if I have been so fortunate as to lead you to the same conclusion, you will perhaps extend to me your congratulations."

"I trust," continued the doctor, "that no time will be lost in making my discovery practically useful. But first, I must, I suppose, furnish myself with a better knowledge of its potentialities; learn to recognize the subtle and radiating influence of the subconscious mind; and having so done, gradate myself to the new conditions of my existence. And the key to it is this: that a man is not truly one, but truly two."
"""

Question: """What does Dr. Jekyll mean when he says that man is not truly one, but truly two?"""
Answer: """Dr. Jekyll means that man is not a single, unified entity, but rather a complex amalgamation of different and often conflicting impulses and desires. He suggests that there is a hidden, subconscious part of the human psyche that is separate from the conscious mind, and that this hidden part can exert a powerful influence over a person's thoughts and actions."""

Question: """What is the key to Dr. Jekyll's discovery, according to his own words?"""
Answer: """The key to Dr. Jekyll's discovery is the recognition that a man is not truly one, but truly two. He believes that by understanding the subtle and radiating influence of the subconscious mind, he can learn to control and manipulate the hidden, shadowy part of his own psyche."""

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The process of natural selection, Darwin argued, would lead to the evolution of species. He believed that organisms with traits that allowed them to survive and reproduce more successfully than others would pass those traits on to their offspring. Over time, this would lead to the accumulation of beneficial traits in a population, and the gradual transformation of species.

Darwin also recognized that the process of natural selection could lead to the extinction of species. If a species was unable to adapt to changing environmental conditions, it would be unable to compete with other species and would eventually die out.

Darwin's theory of natural selection was a radical departure from the prevailing views of his time. Many scientists and theologians rejected his ideas, arguing that they undermined the belief in a divine creator. However, Darwin's theory has since been supported by a wealth of evidence from the fields of genetics, paleontology, and molecular biology.
"""

Question: """What is the process of natural selection, according to Charles Darwin?"""
Answer: """The process of natural selection, according to Charles Darwin, is the mechanism by which species evolve over time.

Question: """What is the role of environmental conditions in the process of natural selection?"""
Answer: """Environmental conditions play a crucial role in the process of natural selection. Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their beneficial traits to their offspring.
