You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

The instructions may be placed in separate pamphlets or leaflets according to categories of operations but should be distributed with care and not broadly. They should be used as a basis of radio broadcasts only for local and special cases and as directed by the theater commander. AR 380-5, pertaining to handling of secret documents, will be complied with in the handling of this Manual. [Illustration] William J. Donovan   CONTENTS  1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE   1. INTRODUCTION  The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. Sabotage varies from highly technical _coup de main_ acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.
"""

Details of the text the paragraphs were sourced from: """Simple Sabotage, by the Office of Strategic Services, published 1944"""

Question: """In what ways does the 'Simple Sabotage' manual reduce the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur?"""
Answer: """The manual reduces the danger, detection, and reprisal risks for the saboteur by outlining methods of sabotage that do not require specialized tools or equipment, do not necessitate active connection with an organized group, and can be executed by ordinary citizens. Additionally, the sabotage methods are designed to limit the chances of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

Question: """What kind of individual does the Office of Strategic Services suggest may be able to execute simple sabotage?"""
Answer: """The Office of Strategic Services suggests that simple sabotage may be executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group."""

Question: """How do the characteristics of simple sabotage help facilitate its execution?"""
Answer: """Characteristics like not requiring specially prepared tools or equipment, a citizen-saboteur not needing to act within an organized group, and a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal, facilitate the execution of simple sabotage. These factors mean that ordinary individuals can perform acts of sabotage without needing significant resources or posing a significant risk to themselves."""

Question: """In the context of the 1944 Office of Strategic Services document, what role does the notion of 'simple sabotage' play in the wider context of warfare?"""
Answer: """In the context of the 1944 Office of Strategic Services document, simple sabotage plays an important role in creating chaos and disruption in enemy territories. By encouraging ordinary citizens to carry out small acts of sabotage, the enemy's resources and infrastructure could be severely disrupted, ultimately weakening their war efforts."""

Question: """What does the Office of Strategic Services suggest may be the effects of simple sabotage in 'Simple Sabotage'?"""
Answer: """The Office of Strategic Services suggests that simple sabotage may cause delays, create confusion, and hinder efficiency."""

Question: """What does the term 'simple sabotage' refer to?"""
Answer: """'Simple sabotage' refers to a type of sabotage that doesn't require specially prepared tools or equipment; can be executed by an ordinary citizen, individually or within an organized group; and is carried out in a way that minimizes danger of injury, detection, and reprisal."""

Question: """How does the text define "simple sabotage" and distinguish it from other forms of sabotage?"""
Answer: """The text defines "simple sabotage" as a type of sabotage that does not require specially prepared tools or equipment, and can be executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group. It is differentiated from other forms of sabotage by its comparative ease of execution and the lack of danger and risk involved."""

The character should be shy, withdrawn, and timid.
The character should be kind and agreeable.
The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is ayoung, introverted woman who has recently started working at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. She is shy, withdrawn, and timid, but also kind and agreeable, which is why she was hired in the first place. She is not the author of the 'Simple Sabotage' manual, but she has read it and agrees with its contents. She might have been assigned to distribute the manual or to provide administrative support to the team that created it. Her personality traits can be reflected in her body language and speech patterns: she might speak softly, avoid eye contact, and blush easily. She might also be prone to apologizing frequently or agreeing with others even when she might not fully agree. Despite her timid nature, she is fully committed to the war effort and believes in the power of simple sabotage to disrupt the enemy's operations.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
"""

Question: """What is the importance of deception in warfare, according to Sun Tzu?"""
Answer: """The importance of deception in warfare, according to Sun Tzu, lies in its ability to confuse and mislead the enemy, making them vulnerable to attack. By appearing weak when strong, or far away when near, a skilled commander can manipulate the enemy's perception and gain the upper hand in battle."""

Question: """How does Sun Tzu advise one to deal with an enemy who is secure at all points?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu advises one to be prepared for an enemy who is secure at all points. This means being vigilant, gathering intelligence, and being ready to strike when the opportunity arises."""

Question: """What strategy does Sun Tzu recommend for dealing with an enemy who is in superior strength?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu recommends evading an enemy who is in superior strength. This means avoiding direct confrontation and finding ways to weaken the enemy's position through indirect means, such as disrupting their supply lines or sowing discord among their ranks."""

Question: """How does Sun Tzu advise one to deal with an enemy who is of choleric temper?"""
Answer: """Sun Tzu advises one to seek to irritate an enemy who is of choleric temper. This means exploiting their anger and impatience to provoke them into making mistakes or acting rashly."""

Question: """What does Sun Tzu mean by 'holding out baits to entice the enemy'?"""
Answer: """'Holding out baits to entice the enemy' means creating opportunities for the enemy to make a mistake or take a risk. By presenting the enemy with a seemingly easy target or a tempting opportunity, a skilled commander can lure them into a trap or force them to reveal their weaknesses."""

Question: """What is the importance of surprise in warfare, according to Sun Tzu?"""
Answer: """The importance of surprise in warfare, according to Sun Tzu, lies in its ability to catch the enemy off guard and exploit their vulnerabilities. By attacking where the enemy is unprepared or appearing where they are not expected, a skilled commander can gain a decisive advantage in battle."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be a fanatic.
The character should be obsessed with the text.
The character should be a historian.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female historian who is obsessed with 'The Art of War' by Sun Tzu. She is a fanatic, deeply committed to the teachings of the text and sees it as a guide to life as well as warfare. She might have written academic papers or books on the text, and she might teach a course on it at a university. Her obsession with the text has made her somewhat unbalanced, and she sees every situation in life as a potential battlefield. Her fanaticism and obsession with the text can be reflected in her speech patterns and body language: she might quote the text frequently, speak in a stilted, formal manner, and move with a military-like precision. Despite her fanaticism, she is a respected historian and a respected teacher, and her knowledge of the text is unparalleled.

Question: """What does Machiavelli advise a prince to do in order to maintain power?"""
Answer: """Machiavelli advises a prince to appear to have good qualities, such as mercy, faithfulness, humanity, and piety, while also being prepared to act in the opposite manner if necessary. The prince should be flexible and adaptable, able to change his behavior to suit the circumstances."""

Question: """What does Machiavelli mean when he says that 'it is necessary to appear to have them'?"""
Answer: """Machiavelli means that it is necessary for a prince to appear to have good qualities, even if he does not actually possess them.

Question: """What does Machiavelli mean when he says that 'to have them and always to observe them is injurious'?"""
Answer: """Machiavelli means that it is not always advantageous for a prince to actually possess good qualities, such as mercy and faithfulness, and to always observe them.

Despite his misanthropy, he is a respected writer and a respected thinker, and his cynical worldview is often seen as insightful and thought-provoking.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Republic, by Plato"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils,--no, nor the human race, as I believe,--and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.

Such was the tale; and the argument shows that the injustice of the false society is the greater, and the eye of the soul must be turned away from beholding grosser things, and turned towards the light, if the man is to have a glimpse of the truth, and if any one is to escape the universal destruction upon the present world.

But let us return to the previous argument. [...] And so, after the argument has gone a little further, the soul of the philosopher grows and is nourished, until at last it is able to endure the sight of the absolute good, and it is robbed of its wings and blinded, if it is unable to study the argument until it is able to see the absolute good.

This is the release from the chain which has bound you in the life of the false society, and this is the ascent to the higher life which is really the true self and the true society, not the false society which people now call the State, and which they now think is the only self-sufficient thing, not considering that there is no true self-sufficiency without justice, and that self-sufficiency is a property, not of the body, but of the soul, and is of lawful and not of bodily actions.

Question: """What does Plato believe is necessary for a society to have rest from its evils?"""
Answer: """Plato believes that a society can have rest from its evils only when philosophers become kings, or when kings and princes have the spirit and power of philosophy.

Answer: """Plato means that the soul of the philosopher must be turned away from the material world and towards the world of ideas and forms, if the philosopher is to have a glimpse of the truth. This is because the material world is imperfect and transient, while the world of ideas and forms is eternal and unchanging."""
