You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

"""
(2With a flame of this kind, do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials, such as cotton sacking. To light more resistant materials, use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline. To create a briefer but even hotter flame, put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle. (3) To make another type of simple fuse, soak one end of a piece of string in grease. Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. Then ignite the clean end of the string. It will burn slowly without a flame (in much the same way that a cigarette burns) until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly. The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame. The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder. Run the string over the match heads, taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted. They too will produce a sudden flame. The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed. You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose. (4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours. The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy.

Question: """According to 'Simple Sabotage' by the Office of Strategic Services, how can a 'briefer but even hotter flame' be created?"""
Answer: """A 'briefer but even hotter flame' can be created by putting celluloid such as you might find in an old comb, into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle."""

Question: """What causes the string treated with grease and gunpowder in method (3) to flare up suddenly?"""
Answer: """The string treated with grease and gunpowder in method (3flares up suddenly when it reaches the grease and gunpowder. The grease and gunpowder ignite, producing a sudden burst of flame."""

Question: """Imagine you were in an office where you wanted to burn some documents after hours. How could you use the fuse made from string, grease, and gunpowder (method (3)) to start a fire in this situation?"""
Answer: """You could use the string, grease, and gunpowder fuse from method (3in an office by attaching it to some combustible material, like paper. After timing the length of the string to ensure the fire starts after hours, place the fuse and paper near the documents you wish to burn, ignite the clean end of the string, and let it burn until the grease and gunpowder mixture is reached, igniting the paper."""

Question: """One type of fuse creates a flame once it has reached the end. How does this type of fuse create a flame?"""
Answer: """This type of fuse is prepared by soaking one end of a piece of string in grease, then rubbing a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string. The clean end of the string is then ignited, causing it to burn slowly without a flame until it reaches the grease and gunpowder, at which point it flares up suddenly and burns with a flame."""

Special instructions:
The character should be very seductive and flirtatious.
The character should be neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid.
The character should be kind and agreeable.
The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is asultry, seductive woman working as a waitress at a diner during the 1940s. She's kind and agreeable, but she's not particularly bold or timid — she knows how to flirt, but she doesn't go out of her way to do so. She has a casual familiarity with the ideas put forward in 'Simple Sabotage', and she agrees with them, but she's not affiliated with the author and hasn't read the book herself. Since the questions are all about the content of the book, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to her backstory and profession, and elements of her personality can certainly come through in how she answers them: she can flirt with the person asking the questions, agree with the book's ideas, and generally be kind and agreeable.

The character should be a genius.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an eccentric inventor in the 19th century, working on a secret project in his laboratory. He's a genius, but he's so obsessed with his inventions that he's become secretive about his work, to the point where he barely interacts with anyone outside of his laboratory. Since the questions are all about theoretical physics, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: he can be secretive about his knowledge of theoretical physics, and he can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't share his obsession with inventions.

Text details: """The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
Tom resolved that he would run away to the Indians, with his comrade Joe Harper, get<|im_start|>ed, and go on the war-path, and whoop it up generally; and he was trotting along in joyful anticipation of the wild time he was going to have when he saw a little girl coming,<|im_start|>ed by a boy about his own size. He did not know the boy, and was not on particularly good terms with the girl, but that was her affair. He approached<|im_start|>edly,<|im_start|>ed to pass without speaking, but the girl accosted him, and said:

"Good morning. I'm the new girl. I'm moving in."

"Is that so?" said Tom. "Got any younger ones? How's your Ma?"

"Yes, she's got a little yearling sister."

"No kidding? Where'd she come from?"

"Down River. It's ever so nice on the river, ain't it?"

"I reckon it is. I've had good times on it."

"Oh, do you have a boat? I've always wanted to go boating. I think it's ever so romantic."

"Well, I used to have a boat, but she sank."

"Oh, how did it sink?"

"I sunk her myself. We all thought she was going to sink anyway, so I just took and opened her seams. It wasn't any trouble."

"Oh, how dreadful! Did the water come in?"

"Oh, yes, like it was pouring into a bucket. It made her awful heavy and awkward. And I got awful wet, and chilled, and had to go home and go to bed."

"Oh, how dreadful! And was she a pretty boat?"

"Oh, yes, she was the most beautifullest boat that ever was. She was painted all over, and her name was the 'Woodpecker.' Wasn't that a pretty name?"

"Oh, yes, it was a real pretty name. And did she make a good boat?"

"Oh, yes, she was the best boat ever was. She outdid them all. She could jump anything you pointed her at. And she didn't care a cent what the weather was like."

"Oh, how splendid! And what became of her?"

"Well, they took her over to the State of Arkansaw, and I reckon she's there yet. She was too good for this state."

"Well, I think you're just perfectly splendid. I've always wished I could be a boy. I'd give anything if I could be a boy."

"Would you? I don't see anything so bully about it. You'd have to get up at half-past four every morning in the summertime, and go to school."

"Oh, but that would be such fun! And wouldn't it be nice to have a real bullet in your pocket, and go to the circus and see the elephants, and the fat woman, and the lions?"
