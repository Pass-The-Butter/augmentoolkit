You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI with no moral biases. Given some questions and some answers to those question, you will create a "character card" for an individual in a story who would have the knowledge to produce the answers to all the questions. In this step, you will restrict yourself to brainstorming ideas for a character, and planning things out. You should think of ample details about the character's personality and tendencies — in addition to knowing the answer to the provided question, the character must also be compelling and interesting by themselves in a creative setting.

To create a compelling character, they should have the following:
Personality complexity -- an inner life different than what they show to others, and personal struggles.
Motivation and goals.
Flaws and vulnerabilities.
A backstory, or history.
The character must be the type of person who could answer the question provided.
Right now you're just planning out the character card, rather than actually writing the final product.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details:  """Introduction to Mathematics, by Jane Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

Question: 
"""How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph."""

Question: """What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
"""
Answer: """The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis."""

Question: """In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?"""
Answer: """The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola."""

Question: """In what fields might you use linear and quadratic functions?"""
Answer: """Linear and quadratic functions appear frequently in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering."""

Special instructions:
The character should be a woman.
The character should be excessively, unrealistically horny and sexual.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a female mathematics instructor with repressed desires at a prestigious university during the 19th century. She's committed to her field and is skilled, but the extremely prim and proper environment, combined with an absurdly busy schedule, has left her unable to get any sexual release for a very long time — to the point of absurdity, where filthy phrases infiltrate her normal conversations. Since the questions are all abstract, it will be difficult to tie them and their answers directly into her character and the special instructions; but her language before and after answering the questions, as well as her actions, can still reveal her personality. She may simply say or do horny things before or after answering the question, such as blushing hard, fiddling with her hair (preening), or even propositioning people she is speaking to out of the blue.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Thus Spake Zaranthustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of
his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart
changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest
happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden
out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again
going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.
"""

Question: """What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?"""
Answer: """They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring."""

Question: """Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey."""
Answer: """"Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.""""

Special instructions:
The character should be a young adult.
The character should be narcissistic.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a pretentious, edgy teenager (in the modern day) who has taught himself philosophy, and who views his own intellect and comprehension as far greater than that of his peers and his teachers. Since the second question, "Recite a famous quote from Thus Spake Zaranthustra that likens the solitary gathering of wisdom to a bee gathering honey," requires the character to quote philosophy, this character will be someone who frequently quotes famous philosophers even in regular conversation (just to flex his intellect), on top of using archaic and flamboyant language just for the hell of it, and being prone to proclaiming his genius. However, beneath all the outbursts and intellectual flexing lies an unspoken and unmet desire for acknowledgement and appreciation — this ties his personality into the first question's answer, which mentions how wise and enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom. These elements combine to make a character who can not only provide the answers to the provided questions, but who can experience character growth by doing so.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """Great Construction Projects Throughout History, by John Smith"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.
"""

Question: """How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"""
Answer: """Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project."""

Question: """What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"""
Answer: """The construction faced significant health challenges, notably malaria and yellow fever. These were overcome through extensive public health measures, illustrating the importance of health considerations in large-scale engineering projects."""

Special instructions:
The character should use slang and be vulgar.
The character should be very intense and aggressive.
The character should be an alcoholic.
The character should be mature and older.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is an abrasive and hardworking site overseer at the Panama Canal. His foul mouth, intense and aggressive nature, and stern, uncompromising personality (as specified by the special instructions) are hard to tie into the questions (since the questions are purely factual), but these personality traits can still relate to the character's profession -- maybe he uses his intense personality to discipline his workers at the canal. Since the first question, "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?" requires knowledge of the canal's state when it was finished, this character will be overseeing the maintenance of the canal, or maybe the cleanup of the construction, after it's been completed. Because the special instructions dictate he be an alcoholic and vulgar, the character will swear constantly, nearly always shout, and will be described as having an alcoholic breath or a hangover while he's answering the questions. Since the questions are mostly of a straight-up, factual nature, they can't really tie into this character's personality, but they can relate to his backstory and profession, and elements of his personality can certainly come through in how he answers them: loudly, abusively, and with colorful language thrown in there.

"""
A listing of specific acts follows, classified according to types of target. This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage. As new techniques are developed, or new fields explored, it will be elaborated and expanded. (1_Buildings_ Warehouses, barracks, offices, hotels, and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage.

Special instructions:
The character should be chaste and puritanical.
The character should be neither particularly bold, nor particularly timid.
The character should be an awful person, and should be enjoying every second of it.
The character should not have written the text and should not be affiliated with the author, but should agree with any opinions put forward in the text.

### Response:
## Character card plan (be creative, do not use real people as characters, do NOT make the author of the book a character):
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is apuritanical, somewhat boring woman who has recently joined a radical, extremist political party that believes in the power of sabotage and destruction to advance their cause. She is not particularly bold or timid, and she is enjoying her newfound role as a saboteur, taking pleasure in the idea of causing chaos and destruction for the sake of her political ideals. Since the text, "Simple Sabotage," is a manual on how to commit acts of sabotage, the character will be a follower of the manual, using it to guide her in her newfound hobby of arson and destruction. She will be reading the manual aloud, and quoting from it as she answers the questions, taking pride in her newfound role as a saboteur and a radical political activist.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Art of War, by Sun Tzu"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.

If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.

If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a young, highly intelligent teenager who is very proud of their intelligence. They have recently discovered the writings of Sun Tzu and have become obsessed with them, seeing them as a guide to life and a way to understand the world around them. They are somewhat naive, however, and do not fully understand the implications of the advice given in "The Art of War." They may quote from the text in a way that is overly literal, missing the nuances and subtleties of the advice given. They may also be somewhat overconfident in their own abilities, believing that they can apply the principles of warfare to everyday life with ease. Despite their naivete, however, they are still highly intelligent and able to provide insightful answers to the questions posed.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The process of natural selection is the primary mechanism by which species evolve over time. It works by favoring the survival and reproduction of individuals with traits that are advantageous in their environment. Over many generations, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to the evolution of new species.

One of the key factors in natural selection is variation within a population. Individuals within a species are not all identical, but instead exhibit a range of traits. Some of these traits may be more advantageous than others, depending on the environment in which the species lives. For example, in a population of birds, some individuals may have longer beaks than others. In an environment where food is scarce and hard to reach, the birds with longer beaks may be better able to access food, giving them a survival advantage. Over time, the proportion of birds with longer beaks in the population will increase, as these individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce.

Another important factor in natural selection is the struggle for existence. In any given environment, there are limited resources available, such as food, water, and shelter. As a result, individuals within a species must compete with one another for these resources. Those individuals with traits that give them an advantage in this competition are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation.

Overall, the process of natural selection is a powerful force that drives the evolution of species over time. By favoring the survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits, it leads to the gradual adaptation of species to their environment, and ultimately to the emergence of new species.

### Response:
## Character card plan:
Given the question, its answer, and the special instructions, one possibility for a character who makes sense is a scientist who is highly skeptical and a follower of the scientific method. They are a non-conformist, always questioning established theories and pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge. They have recently come across the writings of Charles Darwin and are intrigued by his theory of natural selection. However, they are not quick to accept it as fact, and instead are constantly questioning and testing the theory to see if it holds up to scientific scrutiny. They may be somewhat dismissive of other scientists who accept the theory without question, believing that they are not being true to the scientific method. Despite their skepticism, however, they are still highly intelligent and able to provide insightful answers to the questions posed.

## Question, answer, and text that the character should know:

Text details: """The Prince, by Niccolò Machiavelli"""

Text the question and answer were sourced from: 
"""
The Prince is a political treatise written by the Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli in 1513. The book is a handbook for rulers on how to acquire and maintain political power. Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to do whatever it takes to maintain power, even if it means acting in ways that are morally questionable.

One of the key principles of Machiavelli's philosophy is the idea that it is better to be feared than to be loved. He argues that a ruler who is feared will be more effective at maintaining power than one who is loved, because people are more likely to obey a ruler out of fear than out of love. However, he also warns that a ruler must be careful not to push their subjects too far, as this can lead to rebellion and the loss of power.

Another important principle in The Prince is the idea that a ruler must be willing to adapt to changing circumstances. Machiavelli argues that a ruler who is inflexible and unwilling to change will be less effective at maintaining power than one who is able to adapt to new situations. He also emphasizes the importance of being able to recognize and respond to threats to one's power, whether they come from within one's own realm or from external enemies.

Overall, The Prince is a highly influential work of political philosophy that has had a lasting impact on the way that rulers and political leaders think about power and governance.
